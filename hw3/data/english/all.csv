Professor: And mad king Ludwig
"would invite guests into the castle linderhof,"
where they would fall victim
to any of his dozens of deadly traps.
Rude.
"Huh. That's why his name was not ""lovable Ludwig"""
"or ""good neighbor king of Bavaria."""
Ohh! Stand back.
"Ah, come on."
What are the odds that these traps still--
yeeh.
Ludwig's lost treasure.
"I'm sure the Booty is booby-trapped, so don't--"
(rumbling)
Touch anything.
Go! Go! Go!
Ohh!
Bad day.
Ha! Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
(Grunting)
(Screaming)
(Jackie screaming)
Snowboarding works much better with snow.
Follow him.
Follow him.
(Bell rings)
"What is it, uncle?"
"Come, give uncle a hug."
Ow!
You did not make coffee this morning.
Coffee is the only thing
keeping uncle's ancient heart beating.
You want dead uncle?
No? Then you make coffee.
Ok.
One more thing.
You received phone call from the university.
They want you to translate parchments.
Ok.
One more thing.
I cannot read these inscriptions.
Very old writing.
"I must go in back, look at my journals."
Ok.
One more thing.
"This is Jade, your niece."
She will live with you for a year. Ok?
Ok.
I have a niece?!
Your cousin shin's girl from Hong Kong.
Jade is not behaving well there--
doing poorly in school.
Your cousin thinks she will do better in America with you.
"Uh, nobody asked me!"
Did not want to bother you.
"Now, you both get acquainted while I go do work."
But I don't know anything about children.
(Nervous laugh)
Hello.
I am Jackie.
Hmm. No English.
<i>Ne ho ma?</i>
(Bell rings)
Welcome to uncle's rare finds.
How can I help you?
"You're Jackie chan, the archeologist?"
"Oh, I dabble in the study of past civilizations."
"Well, we are aware that you recently"
dabbled a shield from a bavarian castle.
Our extremely wealthy employer
is interested in purchasing that shield.
I'm sorry.
I already donated that piece to the university.
Really?
Aah!
It would be in your family's best interests
"to undonate the shield, Mr. chan,"
by this time tomorrow.
Did they buy anything?
No.
You terrible salesman.
Watch the girl and hide the shield.
Where am I going to hide a big shield?
Where did I put it?
Whoa!
Hey! - Aah!
Ow!
Heh. That will buff right out.
Nya nya!
Electric swords?!
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Ow!
No more playtime! Go! Go! Go!
Kid: Let's get out of here!
Aah!
Hey! What the--
wow.
Let's get out of here.
Jade?
Now he's coming to.
Aah!
Augustus black!
What are you doing here?
"Oh, what am I doing here?"
"I'm afraid it's official business, my friend."
I didn't think these were your backup singers.
Where have you been? I don't hear from you for 6 years.
Boom! You're in San Francisco saving my butt.
Whoa. Those thugs must have knocked me out.
"Actually, I knocked you out."
Why did you do that?
Jackie.
I thought we were friends.
"We are, Jackie."
"I'm sorry, but this location must remain secret."
"Oh, yes. I can see this is some very special garbage."
Jackie--
maybe I'll see you in another 6 years.
Excuse me while I call a cab.
"Uh, Jackie--"
(dials phone)
(Screaming)
(Sighs)
(Screaming)
(Elevator dings)
Unh.
Tried to warn you.
How did you get down here?
The stairs.
Follow me.
"Black: Jackie, welcome to section 13."
I thought you were with interpol.
"Even when you knew me then,"
I was shepherding this agency in secret.
You're a spy?
They're spies?
"Law enforcement, Jackie..."
Elite special forces.
So why give me the big tour?
We are aware that you've recently acquired
an artifact in Bavaria.
Why does everyone know this?
Jackie?
You are the second one
to ask me about the shield today.
As I feared.
Want to fill me in?
Black: Section 13 was founded
to investigate large-scale international crimes--
crimes which it seems can often be traced
to a syndicate called the dark hand.
The dark hand has connections
to nearly every criminal activity in existence.
Their leader is this man--
valmont.
You are telling me one man stopped you?
"Uh, yes, but--"
3 of my enforcers
armed with high-tech weapons
were defeated by an archeologist?
Did we mention he had windshield wipers?
Tohru.
Uh-oh. - Whoa!
Whoa.
"Tohru, can't breathe."
Enough.
(Gasping)
"Tohru, bring me the shield."
"While your tohru impresses, valmont,"
perhaps he should be aided by...
The shadowkahn.
"As you wish, shendu."
Black: We recently learned that the dark hand
has a sudden interest in collecting certain historical artifacts.
Why?
"Unknown,"
"but with this new development,"
section 13 could use an archeology expert such as yourself.
"Oh, I'm really just an amateur."
A wise and talented amateur
whom I know and trust.
But my university work--
"it wouldn't be full-time, Jackie."
"Research only, - to help us stay one step ahead of valmont."
I will consider it.
Whoa! - Watch it!
Jackie!
Who is that?!
No relation.
Whoa! - Whoa!
Stand back.
"Jade: Jackie, grab on!"
I'm busting you outta here.
You speak English?!
Jackie: Sorry!
Jackie: Look out!
Sorry! Heads up!
Jackie: Look out!
Jackie: Sorry!
Aah!
"Jackie, how many fingers do you see?"
Look. Fishies.
Let go of me!
"Young lady, how did you get in here?"
The stairs.
Where did you get the bike?
You could have been hurt.
I snuck it out of their garage.
Knew we'd need it to blow this taco stand.
"So, we outta here?"
"Jade, these people are my friends."
Your friends knocked you out
and took you to a supersecret underground base?!
"Uh, yes."
America is so cool!
Care to explain how our security was penetrated by a child?
I'm not a child.
I'm Jackie's niece.
"Didn't know - you had a niece, Jackie."
Join the club.
"Jackie: Jade-- - come on,"
"just admit, wasn't I brave?"
"Yes, but you also need wisdom"
to know when challenges are too big.
Courage without wisdom is foolishness. Understand?
"Uh, my English must not be too good."
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Uncle, on phone: Jackie."
Uncle. - Where are you?
"Uh, can't say."
"Oh, one more thing. Have you seen Jade?"
"Yes, she's with me."
See? I knew you two would get along.
One more thing.
I have been doing research on the shield.
"Jackie, I have found what the inscriptions mean."
They are incantations.
Incantations?
"Magic. Very powerful,"
but the shield not important.
"Of course the shield is important, uncle."
Everybody I meet today wants the shield.
"No, shield not important."
The shield.
Uncle?
Uncle?!
Uncle!
Uncle? Uncle?!
"Your uncle is fine for now, Mr. chan,"
but every hour I do not possess the shield...
"Yes, yes, I understand."
I will bring it. I will tell no one.
"A favor, between friends. Watch my niece."
"Jackie, where are you--"
"please, don't ask questions."
"All right, young lady--"
"ok, where would uncle hide the shield?"
Hmm.
Hi! - Aah!
How did you--
the stairs.
"Well, take these stairs to your room."
"Oh, let me help."
"Uncle is my uncle, too-- I think."
Fine. Help find the shield.
Yeeah!
Yeow!
This it?
Yes!
I must be getting that wisdom
you were talking about.
Thank you.
Now go to your room.
"Jade: Uncle's up there, huh?"
You speak English?
You know I do.
"So what part of ""go to your room"""
do you not understand?
Aww.
"Stay here,"
or I'll put you on the first flight
back to Hong Kong.
Scout's honor.
"Tch, like I'm a scout."
(Elevator dings)
The shield.
Why does your employer want it?
That is not your concern.
"Okey-dokey, you want the shield,"
catch!
Fool. Say sayonara to your uncle!
Huh?
Arrgh!
I bet I run faster than you.
Come and get it?
Aah!
"Hurry, uncle!"
Ai-ah.
(Elevator music playing)
Yaah!
Jackie!
Mine!
Oof! - Oof!
The shield.
Yaah!
(Groans)
Heh heh.
(Groans)
(Helicopter)
(Over loudspeaker) Honest! It's a research position.
"Jackie, I never meant for your family"
to get involved in this.
It's not your fault.
The dark hand was after the shield.
Ow!
I told you!
Shield not important.
The talisman in the center of the shield is.
That is where the magic lies.
"Uh, don't you worry. We'll be sure to look into that"
once we - reclaim the talisman from the dark hand.
Don't need to.
Admit it.
I'm getting wise.
Master.
Shendu and valmont: Tohru.
What?
One more thing.
See the markings?
"Sign of the rooster, from the Chinese zodiac."
There are 11 more talismans where that came from.
"And my gut tells me the dark hand's after them, too."
"You onboard, Jackie?"
Uh... Jade: Absolutely.
"Child: Hey, Jackie, what inspired you to make this TV show?"
"When I was young, I always like cartoon."
I really hoped someday I want to be a cartoon character.
Cartoon can do all kind things I cannot do in my real life.
"After so many, so many, so many years later,"
"the people, the children still can remember me."
Today my dream come true.
I love cartoon.
<i>Previously on</i> <i>Jackie chan adventures</i>
"this is Jade, your niece."
I have a niece?
I cannot read these inscriptions.
Very old writing.
The dark hand has connections
to nearly every criminal activity in existence.
Their leader is valmont.
You're telling me one man stopped you?
"Tohru, bring me the shield."
Uncle: Jackie!
I have found what the inscriptions mean.
"They are incantations,"
but the shield not important.
"Of course the shield is important, uncle."
Everybody I meet today wants the shield.
Shield not important.
The talisman in the center of the shield is.
That is where the magic lies.
"Shendu: Valmont, are your men blind?"
It would seem - those possessed of sight
might have taken note
that the shield contained no talisman.
Why's the boss taking guff from a statue?
"Uh, 'cause it talks."
"Now, if my promise to you of unspoiled riches"
were as empty as that shield...
"Rest assured, shendu,"
"you <i> will</i> have your talisman,"
and I <i> will</i> ensure that Jackie chan
never again interferes with the dark hand...
Ever.
Jade: Chinese food?
I just moved here from Hong Kong.
Can't we get some Tex-mex?
Jackie...
The rooster talisman possesses enormous power.
What's it do?
"Manners, Jade."
Ancient legend speaks of 12 talismans--
"one for each animal of the Chinese zodiac,"
each possessing a different magic.
What <i> kind</i> of magic?
Jackie: Jade...
Legend also says the talismans were scattered
to the 4 corners of the globe.
If this or any talisman should fall into evil hands...
Jackie'll give 'em smackie
with his lightning fists of steel!
"Hey, when are you gonna teach me some of your moves?"
"Later, Jade."
Humph.
"Uncle,"
do you really believe in such a myth?
Ow!
Does that answer your question?
"Jade: Jackie, check me out!"
I got the moves!
Hee-yah!
Jade?
Not indoors!
Aah!
Fire!
Aah!
My niece is very sorry.
"Whoa! Aren't you, niece?"
I am such a dork.
"I was just trying to get you to teach me, Jackie."
The wise seek power within themselves.
The foolish seek it within others.
Until you harness the power
"within yourself, I cannot teach you."
Huh?
It means you must have the discipline
to behave yourself. Now eat your food.
Power within. Got it.
Mmm.
Don't eat like a baboon!
You should chew your food.
(Swallowing and gulping)
<i>Hello?</i> Chew soup?
Help me out here.
She's your niece.
(Swallowing)
Ahh. Tastes like chicken.
"Ooh, dessert!"
"""Danger looms in your future."""
We must be very cautious.
Pff. You listen to a cookie?
"Evenin', chan."
Never mock the cookie.
Where's the talisman?
"Come on, let's go. Man: Check, please."
Hgggh!
"Go, Jackie!"
Unnh!
Ha!
Leave the rough stuff to Jackie.
(Grunts)
"Go, uncle."
Thank you for dining with us.
(Gasps)
The talisman!
It was right there. They took it!
Come on. We can catch 'em.
Stay with uncle.
Come. Sit.
(Gasps) The restaurant manager!
He looks <i> very</i> angry.
Where?
Ayah.
"Mr. valmont, sir."
It didn't go quite as planned.
Regale me.
"Well, - we stomped chan."
Stomped him good.
But we didn't see any talisman.
You will be punished.
"Shendu: Hindsight, valmont."
But perhaps the blind <i>can</i> be made to see
with the eyes of a dragon.
"""Stay with uncle."""
Tcch. - Didn't say <i> which</i> uncle.
Who has the keys?
He's coming!
(Jackie panting)
Hmm.
(Screams)
What's the big--
"oh. Uh, hi."
You followed me?
What do you hear when I talk?
"Tell me, does it sound like blah blah,"
"blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah?"
Jackie.
This is not funny. This is dangerous.
(Muffled)
See?
Dangerous.
Come on!
Aren't you gonna whomp 'em?
(Panting) Ancient Chinese proverb--
do not fight when you can run.
(Panting)
You go that way. But--
go! You'll be safer away from me.
(Panting)
Huh?
Why are they chasing <i> me?</i>
Please have 4 wheels.
(Grunting)
Yes!
Nooo!
Jade!
Sorry. I'll bring it right back.
Whoa!
Ohhhh!
"Jackie, you rule!"
(Gasps)
Aaaah!
"Whoa! Hey, kid, watch where you're going!"
No!
Huh?
How'd I do that?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Jackie!
No cutting in line.
(Grunting)
Jackie!
Grab on!
Help.
Why do you want the girl?
Unnh!
"Oh, ninja-man..."
(Grunting)
I don't understand why they were after--
"Jackie, the coolest thing ever happened."
"I went right off the bridge, but I didn't fall."
"I, like, stopped in midair,"
and then I ran back just like in cartoons.
I can fly.
"Jade, enough fooling around."
Fooling around? I just saved your butt!
"Language, Jade."
"The dark hand is after you,"
and I want to know why.
Unh.
The talisman.
I don't have it! You guys have it.
Don'tcha?
Ungh.
"Oh, uh..."
"Tohru: The tracker points to the girl,"
but she does not have the talisman.
"Well, it must be hidden on her <i> somewhere,</i> tohru."
I'm sure she didn't eat it.
Shendu: Man <i> is</i> much the wiser
when he looks within.
I understand.
And while you're at it...
Eliminate Jackie chan.
Jade: Hello?
Let me out of here! I mean it!
Just wait'll - the jackinator comes to.
You guys are gonna get <i>so</i> creamed.
Jade?
Jackinator?
(Elevator bell rings)
Tohru: Aha.
"Aha, what? What's aha?"
What are you gonna do with that?
"Oh, boy."
The rooster thing's in my stomach.
But when did I--
the restaurant! - The restaurant!
How could you not notice you swallowed a golf ball?
I told you to chew your food.
It was soup!
Never mind. We have to get you out of here
before he gets the talisman out of you.
The <i> magic</i> uncle was talking about.
I'll fly out!
(Groaning)
(Straining)
"Jade, even if you could fly--"
and I'm not saying you can--
"you are tied down to a big, heavy table"
which is bolted to the floor!
Jade: Grrr!
Jackie: Jade?
Whoa.
Oh...You're tele-tele-tele--
you can move things with your mind!
"No, with my stomach! (Gasps)"
Hold still.
"Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus."
Grrrrrr!
Why do you growl?
Heh?
Ungh!
"Guess I have that ""power within"" you were talking about."
Not what I meant. Now cut yourself free!
"Uh, right."
(Grunting and groaning)
(Elevator bell rings)
"Yo, big t, what's all the racket down--"
chan.
"Jade, run...Fly...Something!"
Whoa!
Huh?
Get the girl.
"Payback time, Jackson."
Nyah-nyah!
I <i> hate</i> fish.
Why fight when you can run?
You're learning.
This way!
(Elevator bell rings)
And when you <i> can't</i> run?
Don't watch.
Tcha. Like I'm not gonna watch.
Nooo!
Unh!
I can take him!
Hee-yah!
Uhhh-uhhh-ahh.
(Grunting)
Whoa!
Stop helping!
Stop helping!
Heh. Sorry.
Jackie!
Gotta hit tohru
with the biggest thing I can find...
Himself!
Hoowahh!
Huh?
(Grunts) He's big.
Can't hold much longer.
"Oh, no."
(Grunts) Unh.
Whoa!
"Heh, sorry."
"I'm telling you, uncle was right."
The talismans <i> do</i> possess magic powers.
"Of course they do, Jackie."
"Now, why don't you get some sleep."
All my stuff?
How'd it get here?
"Until we can take down the dark hand,"
it's safer for you here inside section 13.
I hope it feels like home.
But...What about uncle?
<i>Good</i> magic is stronger than <i> bad</i> magic.
He refused to move. Something about
messing up his feng shui something.
Uncle is very stubborn.
Stomach successfully pumped.
(Groaning)
Cock-a-doodle-do.
What about her?
I trust you'll keep your niece in check.
(Jade gasps)
Does this mean I'm a secret agent?
No! - No!
Ohh!
"Emmanuel: Hey, Jackie."
Why do you do all your own stunts in your movies?
I was doing stunts so many years.
The audience see the actor or the bad guy--
"they do all the stunts,"
then the audience just clapped.
"Then I look at my friend,"
"""hey, that's not the actor. That's me."""
"Then I promised myself, one day,"
"when I become a star, I want to do my own stunts."
"I will turn around, let the audience see that's me,"
that's not the double.
"And also, I want to show my children, my grandchildren,"
"look, that's your grandfather."
That's your--your father.
And besides...
I just like it.
(Breathing hard)
A Chinese talisman in the tip of Mexico.
Uncle wasn't kidding
about the 4 corners of the globe thing.
Finn: He's in the pyramid.
Let's move.
"Uh, don't pyramids have mummies inside them, sir?"
Only in Egypt.
Why don't we just let chan find the talisman?
Just take it from him when he climbs out.
"Listen, new guy,"
we don't know what power this ox talisman has.
Chan might come bustin' out of there 50 feet tall
with laser eyes.
I don't want to fight giant laser eyes!
"Everyone after him! Now, now, now!"
Huh?
Where is it?
Arrghh!
Augh!
"Finn: Thanks for all your hard work, chan."
"Hey, where is it?"
I don't know! Finn: Liar.
Where is the talisman?
Someone else must've found it.
Years--centuries ago!
I do not believe you.
(Spooky voice) Ooh-h-h-h-h!
Ooh-h-h-h!
Mummy!
Mummy: Oooh-h-h!
Oooh-h-h-h!
Mummy! Run!
Oooh-h-h!
Jade?!
"<i>Qu pasa, Jackie?</i>"
Chan!
Run!
(All panting)
After them!
Why are you here?
You are supposed to be back at the hotel
doing your homework!
Lucky for you I breezed through.
Tohru was gonna bust you like a piata.
"Thank you, but don't finish your homework early again."
It's too dangerous.
"Whoa, dude!"
I'm sorry! I'll bring it back! Thank you!
Whoa! - Whoa! - Whoa!
"Jade: Oh, yeah!"
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
(Sputtering)
Think--think there's sharks?
"The ancient pyramids,"
"the hang-gliders,"
the churros!
"Mexico is mondo-coolio, Jackie!"
The talisman could be a million miles away.
"Let's ask around, see what the locals know."
"Ooh, mariachis."
"Ok, but don't go anywhere."
Uh-huh.
<i>:Hola!</i> I am paco.
What might a charming seorita such as yourself
be doing this evening?
Eeyeew! Are you asking me on a date?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I am gathering an audience for El toro fuerte.
El who-o what-e?
"El toro fuerte, Mexico's mightiest wrestler."
He has never lost a match.
I want to grow up to be just like him.
Wrestling? Tsst! Everyone knows it's all fake.
(Gasps)
El toro fuerte is no fake.
"El toro fuerte's undefeatable,"
because El toro fuerte is the best!
"Oh, really?"
See that guy over there?
<i>He's</i> the best wrestler in the world.
The mouse man?
He can smack your boy down.
Cannot.
Can too.
Cannot. - Can too.
Cannot. - Can too.
"Then the 2 best should meet, don't you think?"
"I will see you <i> and</i> your mouse man tonight, seorita..."
Jade.
"<i>Adios, Jade.</i>"
"Jackie, we <i> have</i> to go to the wrestling match."
Nice 'brero.
I'm glad you like it.
They had your size.
"<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>"
"Anyway, I told this boy"
that you're the best wrestler in the world.
You have to prove it.
"Jade, one should not fight for the sake of fighting,"
but only when one has no other choice.
Makes sense.
When you get in the ring
"and this El toro guy starts wailing on you,"
you'll have no other choice.
"Uh, you have an interesting mind, young Jade."
Jackie! You've nothing better to do tonight.
"Oh, I don't?"
How about search for the ox talisman?
But you said yourself it could be a million miles away.
Or right under our noses.
Humph! Didn't peg chan as a sports fan.
What sport?
Wrestling's fake. Everybody knows that.
"You came all the way here,"
and you're <i> not</i> going to get in the ring?
Jackie!
"<i>Buenas noches,</i> Jade."
Paco! Hi.
I see you have brought a challenger for El toro fuerte.
Not exactly.
"Paco, can you tell me what this is?"
"Of course. It is the sign of El toro fuerte,"
for he is strong like the ox.
"(Whispering) I would fear him, too, if I were you."
"Come, Jade. We have seats right in front."
"Um, El toro fuerte?"
<i>Si.</i>
"Uh, I'm from housekeeping."
There's been a mix-up.
Your mask has not been properly cleaned.
What? El toro fuerte <i>never</i> removes his mask.
"Uh, that's what I told my boss, but he won't listen."
He insists you cannot fight with a dirty mask.
You--
"hello, chan."
The talisman?
Huh?!
Get him!
Where'd he go?
Whoa! - Seor!
It is time.
"<i>Amigos,</i> welcome to <i> lucha libre!</i>"
Tonight 2 titans will clash here in this very ring.
El pollo enmascarado...
And the undefeated champion...
El toro fuerte!
"Tonight one shall drink deep from the cup of victory,"
and the loser shall be unmasked!
Where'd they get <i>this</i> mouse man?
Jackie?
Awesome! You're gonna do it!
Only because I have no other choice.
"If I win, El toro will be unmasked,"
and I can take the talisman before valmont's thugs do.
Grrr!
Ooh!
(Chanting) Tor-o! Tor-o! Tor-o!
Ok then.
Hyiii--oh!
(Groans)
<i>Uno...Dos...Tres!</i>
The winner!
"Jade, do not watch."
This is the part where Jackie must lose his mask
"and, regrettably, his dignity."
It's chan! Get him!
No.
He does not have the talisman.
"Remember, Jackie,"
each talisman possesses a different magic.
"Yes, yes, uncle."
"12 animals, Chinese zodiac."
One more thing.
What happened to you?
"You lost that match so fast,"
and he gave you such a whupping!
I know. He was strong.
Hmm. Perhaps the power of the ox talisman
is strength.
"Oh, of course! Strength!"
One more thing.
Ow!
Jackie! Jackie!
Wake up!
Where is El toro?
He left. Everyone left!
The match is over.
How could you not win?
"Jade, the ox talisman"
gives El toro superhuman strength!
Knew it! Wrestling is so fake!
Ha ha ha.
"Another autograph, paco?"
"One for your every victory, seor fuerte."
<i>Gracias.</i>
Finn: El toro.
Meet tohru.
"Tohru, toro."
"Toro, tohru."
Tohru--
the mask.
El toro fuerte never removes his mask.
Then I will remove it for you.
Arrhh!
Aah!
Unnh!
That's it. New guy quits.
He nailed tohru.
Nobody nails tohru!
(Whistles)
El toro's been eating his spinach.
The dark hand will send more.
Paco: More?
This is too exciting!
Aww! - Aww!
"El toro, sir!"
"Uh, seor."
"Ahh, I trust you had a pleasant siesta."
"Listen, bad men are after you."
They want the talisman. They know it is magic.
What talisman?
<i>That</i> one.
I don't know what you're talking about.
On your head. <i> There.</i> Ow!
<i>Never</i> touch the mask.
You are in danger.
"Jade, sing-song: ¶ oh, Jackie ¶"
¶ they're here ¶
wrestlers?
Shadowkhan.
Hyah!
Unh!
Told ya Jackie rocks.
"Indeed, but El toro is better."
Is not. - Is too.
Is not. - Is too.
Is not. - Is too.
Arrggh!
Hoowah!
Unh! Ohh!
Sorry.
Ha ha! Again?
Unnh!
(Gasps) The mask!
El toro fuerte never removes his mask!
No!
Jackie!
Put him down! Put him down! Put him down!
Put him down put him down! Pu--ack!
Oh!
A souvenir for valmont.
Jade was right.
You <i> are</i> a fake!
Jackie.
"Mr. toro, we've <i> got</i> to help Jackie."
Paco is right.
I <i> am</i> a fake.
"Come on, come on, come on!"
Up we go!
"With the power of the ox, I was undefeatable."
Hah!
I think I hear Jackie screaming.
You know? The nice guy you knocked out twice!
"He's in big trouble, and you owe him!"
"But without the mask, I can help no one."
"Hey, lookee here! You're golden!"
"And without the talisman, the mask is useless."
Forget about the magic!
"Look, Mr. toro, Jackie once told me"
the wise seek power within themselves.
The foolish seek it within others.
<i>Que?</i>
"Yeah, I don't know where Jackie gets this stuff either,"
but what I think it means is
you're not gonna let a little girl
"go fight those bad boys all by herself, are you?!"
Now his legs.
Jackie?
I'll teach that kid some manners.
Psych!
Auut!
Unh! - Unh!
"<i>Hola, Jackie!</i>"
"No, no, no! The talisman is onboard in a box!"
Don't let them take off with it!
Jade!
Huh?
Wha?
(Huffing)
(Gasping)
Aa-aa-aa-aah!
Situation.
(Both grunting)
Jackie: Help!
(Gasps)
Whoa!
Pull me in! Pull me in!
Unh!
I'm not strong enough!
Unh!
Not strong enough?!
"The talisman, duh!"
(Both grunting)
Huh? Hey!
Hyah!
Unh!
"Well, look at me!"
I'm Jackie chan!
And...You're the pilot.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Aah!
(Gasping for breath)
Oh! Ahh.
(Both grunting)
If that is the pilot...
Who's flying the plane?!
Unhhh!
Aah! - Aah! Aah!
Tsst! A little help here?
"El toro fuerte, you are no longer my hero."
Mr. toro!
"<i>Gracias, Jade,</i>"
but I would rather lose with dignity
than win by deception.
El toro?
Whatever.
Unh! - Unh!
Ohh! - Ohh!
Now tell me...
Who is the mightiest?
Jade: Give you a clue.
Hyah!
Ohh!
"Can I keep it, Jackie?"
No.
Aww!
Paco: El toro fuerte!
Will you teach me the ways of the wrestler?
With all the wisdom of my experience.
You are the greatest!
Jade: No.
Jackie's the greatest.
No. El toro.
Jackie. - El toro.
"Hey, Jackie,"
how do you keep in shape?
Most important is the training and training and training.
All kinds of exercise--
"like swimming, boxing,"
"badminton, tennis, jogging is good for shape."
"Remember, it's the exercise."
Exercise. Then you keep in shape.
Jackie: Please! You must let me have the talisman.
It is only a matter of time
before the dark hand tries to steal it.
"We do so appreciate the warning,"
"Mr., uh, chan, was it?"
"However, the museum security"
has recently been upgraded
to ensure the safety
of the world-famous pink puma diamond.
If we can be trusted to guard
"a gem of - such enormous value,"
I'm sure that your dark hand
will present no serious threat.
Ugh!
Ohh!
I'm so sorry! I broke your spy camera--
spy camera?!
Chan?! - You!
"Uh, dark hand guy!"
"Ow! Hey, I'm walking here!"
Whoa!
"You're planning a heist, aren't you?"
When is it?
(Gasps)
(Cell phone ringing) Aah!
"(Using deep voice) Uh, yeah?"
"Valmont: Is reconnaissance complete, ratso?"
Uh...Yeah!
Excellent. Then hit the museum at midnight.
Tonight?!
Is there a problem?
"Uh--ahem! No, boss!"
(Sighs) No problem at all.
Jackie: We can't let him take the talisman.
The magic--
"so, what you gonna do?"
Sneak into the museum before the bad guys do
and steal the talisman yourself?
Huh?! Steal? What?! Ohh!
"That's crazy, Jade."
You're crazy!
You totally <i> are</i> gonna steal it!
"Can I come with you, Jackie?"
No.
"(Whining) Jackie, please!"
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving!
It's Thanksgiving Eve.
Where's your Turkey day spirit?
"Jade, I really want to spend time with you,"
"but remember,"
you came into my life
the same day as section 13
<i>and</i> the dark hand.
Things have been hectic.
"Now, you can't come with me tonight,"
but I promise I'll take you
to the parade tomorrow.
All right.
Humph!
Hmm. I said I wouldn't come with.
Didn't say I wouldn't follow.
11:00.
One hour till company arrives.
Mmm! Wintergreen!
"Oh, come on!"
Oh! Ohh! Ah! Whoo!
Ah! Ohh! Whoo!
(Sighs heavily)
"Hi, Jackie! Aah!"
No parade for you.
You got in! You are so cool!
I'm not cool! I'm breaking the law.
Uh-huh.
The clock is ticking.
"Uh, make yourself useful."
I think this mirror is broken.
Hyah!
Wow! She rules!
"Uh, I mean... Go, Jackie."
Hyah! (Gasps)
(Both sigh)
You guys are 20 minutes early!
What guys? I'm an independent.
You're not with the dark hand?
Name's viper.
Both: Someone else is after the talisman?!
Talisman? I just nicked the pink puma.
"Wow! When I grow up,"
I wanna be just like her!
(Gasps) A criminal?!
A female Jackie chan.
(Sputtering) She is nothing like me!
"Uh, what's with the minor?"
Some kind of youth outreach program?
Stay out this!
"In fact, you are under arrest!"
"You do realize we'd both go to jail, right?"
I am not a crook!
I am an archaeologist!
(Alarm going off) Both: Way to go.
Viper!
"Ok, no more ""follow the viper""."
No problem!
(Sirens approaching)
"Whoa! Jackie, we're rich!"
Ah! The puma? Ohh! The talisman!
Viper! Come back!
Viper!
Don't go anywhere!
(Gasps) Officer: Freeze! Hands in the air!
Let's rock 'n' roll!
These saps won't know what--
hit 'em?
Jackie chan? A thief?
"Well, perhaps there's hope for him after all."
And what a thief!
"I mean, the pink puma."
And the talisman.
"Go directly to jail, ratso."
"If chan has the talisman,"
this will lead you to it.
Uncle on phone: Jackie...
Why did you steal the pink puma?
There is no puma
in the Chinese zodiac.
It has no magic!
"I know, uncle. It's complicated."
One more thing... You are a criminal!
You are - a very bad influence on Jade!
I know! That's why I need you
to take the next flight here and--
one more thing--
"oh, wait. I am getting another call."
"Oh! No, no, no, no, uncle!"
You don't know how to do that!
I--I am only allowed one phone call!
Hello! Uncle's rare finds.
May I help you?
(Dial tone)
Oh!
"Officer: Chan, visitor."
"Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie!"
"Jade, are you ok?"
"The ""big meow"" is comfy cozy."
What?
"""The cat"" is in the bag."
What?!
I have the pink puma!
Slipped it in my pocket when you weren't looking.
Guess I sorta... Pulled a viper.
"Well, don't pull any more vipers!"
She's a bad influence.
"In fact, hand the puma over"
to the police right now.
Tsk! Like I was gonna bring it in here!
"Besides, we need to get the talisman back."
Said so yourself.
I was thinking I could track down viper
and arrange a trade.
We'll meet under a rusty bridge!
Betcha New York has tons of really cool rusty old Bridges!
"Jade, captain black should be here"
anytime to clear up this whole mess.
"Once I'm out of jail,"
<i>i</i> will find viper.
Ohh! You get to do all the fun stuff!
"This is serious, Jade."
I still don't know what power
the snake talisman possesses.
Viper or the entire city
could be in danger.
Baby face returned
to the scene of the crime?
(Laughs) Why on earth
would he do something so--
stupid.
What am I supposed to do with this?
(Gasps)
Whoa!
(Viper's footsteps)
Now you see me.
Now you don't.
"Hello, bro."
What do you want?
What rock is the legless reptile under?
What?
Tell me where the serpent sleeps.
What are you talking about?
Where's the snake talisman?!
Don't you read the newspaper?
I took the pink puma.
"See? No talisman, like the gizmo says."
"Now, if you'll excuse me,"
my delicious prison food is getting cold.
"I'll find it, chan! Just a matter of time!"
Huh?
(Footsteps)
(Screams) A ghost!
"Viper: Hey, there, baby face. It's me!"
Viper? - The one and only.
And I discovered your little trinket's secret power.
"Oh, really? What does it--"
d'oh! Never mind.
Enough chitchat. Let's bust you out of here.
What?! No!
I don't want to be busted out!
You do if you want your doohickey back.
Or should I just sell the snake
to the highest bidder?
Hey!
Viper: I got it.
Unh! Ohh! Whoa!
Viper: Follow me!
I can't see you-- whoa!
Jade: Psst! Psst!
Did you bring the goods?
(Chuckles) Who are you people?
"Uh, this is not a good idea."
This is a felony!
"You do want your tchotcke back, don't you?"
Ohh! Just hurry
before the dark hand finds us.
"You're all right, Jade."
You got a sharp criminal mind.
I do?!
No! Jade has a lousy criminal mind! Come on!
"Hey, viper! Wanna come"
to the parade with us? - Jade!
We're not going to socialize with a criminal.
"Maybe another time. Stay sharp, kid."
"Jackie, you should ask viper out on a date!"
She'd be such a cool aunt!
What the--
(gasps) It's counterfeit!
Now she has the gem <i>and</i> the talisman!
Viper pulled a viper...
On me?
Old proverb...
"""There is no honor among thieves."""
Let's find her.
Let's!
(Gasps)
Tea?
How'd you get past my security system?
"The talisman, please."
It's not for sale.
"(Chuckles) Oh, I didn't plan on buying it."
"Fellas, secure the talisman."
"Viper: Can't have what you can't see, sugar."
And you can't hide
from the dark hand.
Let me go!
(Window opens)
"The ledge! And while you're at it,"
"pilfer the puma, <i>por favor.</i>"
Ugh! We lost her.
They didn't!
"Look, Jade!"
You get to watch the parade after all!
"Uh, wait here. I'll get you a soda."
Grr!
I'm sorry! I'll bring it back! Thank you!
Hey! - Look out!
Watch it! Excuse me! Sorry!
Jade: Unh!
Whoa! Heads up!
Ohh!
Jackie!
"Hey, sorry about the double cross."
But can you blame me? It's my sign!
Snake. Viper. Get it?
(Sighs)
Here!
"Jade: Make sure it's real this time, Jackie."
And where's my soda?
D'oh! Ack!
(Gasps) Company!
Whoa!
Whoa! - Check it out! Wow!
Jackie: Ha ha! I'm here!
"No, I'm here!"
Or could I be here? Or maybe here?
Ha ha! Perhaps I'm over here!
Or maybe I'm nowhere at all!
Oh.
(Screams)
Alley-oop!
Nice move.
Please! I do not socialize with criminals.
Ow! Ugh! Aah! Unh!
Ooh!
Green is totally your color.
Mine!
Aah!
(All screaming)
All: Whoa!
"Well, I am getting to see the sights."
What sights?
It just vanished! Where'd it go?
(Sirens approaching) That would be my cue.
"Sorry I let you down, kid."
"Yeah, whatever."
"And thanks for the save back there, baby face."
I owe you one.
Then give me back the puma!
I have to return it.
The police think I took it. Please!
"Uh, Jackie?"
I know you told me
"never to pull a viper again, but..."
She owed you one.
But how-- - officers: Freeze!
It's ok! I have it! It's yours!
"Real good. Now, tell us what you did"
with the statue of Liberty.
"Ernie: Hey, Jackie? Yes?"
Do you ever get scared doing a stunt?
"Yes, of course."
"Every time when I'm doing a stunt,"
"my heart just, like, beating--boom-boom!"
"Chasing, jump over the building,"
"across the motorcycle,"
"uh, into the car, outside the car in one shot."
"I'm crazy, but I'm not stupid."
"I know how far I can jump,"
how high I can go. Boom-boom!
Of course I'm afraid. I'm not a Superman.
I just like to do it.
Especially in the theater
"when the audience, ""yeah!"""
Everything's worth it.
The sheep talisman?
"Oh, Jackie had a little lamb."
(Crash)
It's not here.
Can you believe it?
Hah.
Guess not.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello.
Jade: Jackie! Help!
"Jade, what's wrong?"
Never leave me with uncle again.
We eat nothing but mung beans and rice.
And he reeks of garlic.
And uncle's no fun.
"I asked him if we could go to the new Melvin moose amusement park,"
"and he's all, ""roller coasters are bad for digestion."""
Ahh! No!
I know! Can you believe it?
So you promise we'll go as soon as you get home?
Promise?
"Yes! Whatever, I promise!"
Good-bye!
"Valmont, score! (Chuckles)"
And chan?
We'll miss him dearly.
Hohh!
Aah!
(Whimpering)
You need to jump!
(Whimpering)
Aah! - Unh!
Uhh!
No way he's human.
Ohh...
"Ahh! Bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Eyaah!
Fly! Fly! Fly!
Yaaaa!
One stop shopping.
(Grunt)
No!
Did I do that?
Jackie!
Uhh! Hello Jade.
Did you--
I'm going to Melvin world.
"Oh, what?"
"Uh, oh, ok."
But first I go home and get some sleep.
Aw...
Jackie!
Uncle!
What did you bring me?
The sheep talisman?
Good!
Now we can do research!
"Oh, but I'm very tired."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Wait.
What is it? What do you hear?
Ow!
I hear the sound of the sheep
not telling me what power it holds.
I hear the sound of our footsteps
walking to the back room
to translate ancient inscriptions.
"Please, uncle, I have been traveling for 18 hours."
I jump from a helicopter and ran along a falling train.
That is why you must relax with some good books.
Chan possesses yet another talisman...
While I have none?!
"You are weak, valmont!"
And your men are fools!
That's it! I ain't taking no more lip from a statue.
I am no statue!
You stand in the presence of a demon sorcerer.
I once held dominion over a vast empire.
But my subjects betrayed me.
"They cast a <i> chi</i> spell,"
"which imprisoned me in this pitiful icon,"
where I have remained for 900 years.
The 12 magic talismans from which I drew my power
was scattered to the winds.
Whoa!
You got jacked!
Acquisition of all the talismans
will allow me to be free of my confinement
and walk the earth once again.
At which time we will be rewarded
the lost treasure of shin shi-wah.
"Well worth taking a little lip,"
don't you think?
"Uncle: Jackie,"
these symbols explain
the talisman's power.
We must find a translation.
(Snoring)
Ow! Counting sheep makes me sleepy!
One more thing...
"We must keep the talisman in this magic box,"
where it will be concealed from the dark forces.
One more thing... Stay awake!
You break many antiques when you sleepwalk.
"Oh, I don't sleepwalk!"
So! You break
my antiques for fun?!
I'll find out what it does the easy way.
Hmm. Just hope it isn't the exploding head talisman.
Work already!
Uhh!
"(Gasps) Oh, no! I'm dead!"
Huh? Hmm.
I'm...Not dead?
Cool! This must be the--ooh!
Ghost talisman! Jackie won't believe it!
Boo! Hello!
Can't you guys see me?
No? Then I guess you won't mind if I
touch your guts! (Laughing)
Melvin world can't touch this!
Wahoo!
Waste of time!
They probably got it locked up
"at section 13 by now,"
wherever that is.
"Uh, I'm sorry, did you say something?"
No way! Yes way!
"Ratso: So then chan lifts a whole bus off the ground,"
and he Chucks it at us!
"He wasn't easy to take down,"
but we knew how much you wanted this.
"Cheers, shendu."
The first of an even dozen.
I am free!
The sheep talisman enables me
to project my astral form.
"An admirable start,"
but I must have the others.
"Yeah, but finding section 13 won't be"
as easy as taking a talisman
out of a sleeping kid's hand--ow!
Did that occur before or after chan
"""chucked the bus""?"
(Hisses) This sleeping child
may not be sleeping at all.
"And if her spirit wanders,"
her vessel has a vacancy!
Jade: Ew! Quit picking your nose!
(Sighs) Being a ghost of golden gate park
is pretty lame if no one can see you. I'm outie!
(Yawns) Hmm.
Jade is awfully quiet.
Oh! Like a baby!
Hmm.
(Jackie snoring)
Oh! Like a baby!
Ohh! Where's the talisman?
Whoa! What are you?
Everything you will grow to fear!
(Hissing)
(Gasps)
"Uh! Oh, wha--"
"time to awaken, dear uncle."
"Sorry, Charlie! But my body"
ain't big enough for the both of us.
Unh!
Unh! Get out of there!
Give me back my skin and bones!
Unh! Ugh!
"You should not sleep on the floor, uncle Jackie."
(Yawns) We should go back to section 13.
Yes! Section 13.
Uncle: Jackie!
(Sighs) Eventually.
Grr!
"Jade: Jackie, she's not me!"
You gotta listen!
"(Growls) Scream all you wish, child."
They are deaf to you!
What do you want with my body?
What do you want with Jackie?
Gaah!
"Jackie, Jackie, Jackie! Look out!"
Refreshments anyone?
Orange slices and oolong tea
for my cherished elders?
Wonderful!
"Thank you, Jade!"
It's probably poisoned! Don't!
"Jackie, no!"
Mmm! Delicious!
And nutritious.
"Jackie, she is so not me!"
How could you fall for that
sweet-as-pie routine?
She's some kind of evil spirit thing!
Why would an evil spirit act so nice?
"Please forgive my interruption,"
but I wish to go to section 13 now.
And why is it so interested in going to--
(gasps) Section 13! The other talismans!
She--it--must be working for the dark hand!
"(Yawns) Well,"
"Jade wants to go,"
so I'll just--ow!
Arrange a ride for her.
Black.
It's Jackie. Can you send someone
to take Jade back to section 13?
"You all right, Jackie? You sound beat."
(Sighs) I'll be fine.
"It's just between all this travel and research,"
I haven't had much time for Jade.
She really wants to go to this
Melvin world and...
"Your coach awaits, little lady."
Uncle: Hotcha!
The sheep talisman possesses the power
of astral projection.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Great! Night-night!
One more thing!
"Astral bodies can pass through walls,"
but they cannot be seen
duh. - Or heard...
Unless they enter a person's dreams.
Dreams?! Score!
(Snoring)
Aah!
One more thing...
You forget to sweep the store!
(Both sigh)
"Come on, come on! Sweep faster, Jackie!"
(Snoring)
Yes!
Jackie! Can you see me?
"Can't talk, Jade. Sweeping."
Uncle: Jackie!
"Jackie, listen to me!"
You're dreaming!
Not now. Gotta sweep the train.
"Oh! Oh, no!"
What happened?
"Hey, stand still!"
You're dreaming <i>and</i> you're sleepwalking!
Oh! I don't sleepwalk.
(Gasps)
Stop!
(Snoring)
"Uncle Jackie, you're dreaming!"
But I'm real!
"I took the talisman and I got all ghosty,"
but when I got back to my body...
"And so now the bad guys have the talisman,"
and evil me is going to section 13
to steal the rest of them.
And you've gotta stop me!
"I mean, the me outside this dream."
"Dream? Oh, that's crazy, Jade."
You're crazy!
"If I'm the crazy one,"
how come you're the one not wearing pants?
Huh?
"I can prove everything, Jackie."
Look in the box. The talisman's gone!
Now wake up!
Aah!
Ugh!
(Gasps)
My dream was no dream!
Jade is right.
"I'm the bomb, uh-huh. Uh-huh."
Where is the talisman?
"Jade has it. Uh, had it."
"Uncle, this will sound crazy--"
"Jade took the talisman, and now she's trapped in astral form"
while an evil spirit walks in her body.
Uh...Yes!
The sheep talisman put on wolf in sheep's clothing.
You find Jade. - I will find a <i> chi</i> spell to banish the wolf.
"Go, uncle."
"Almost there, Jade."
"I know it may seem silly by now,"
but I have to ask you to wear this.
"At last, section 13."
"Ok, you can look."
(Melvin moose laughing)
A little birdie told me you've been wanting to come here.
Grrr!
Black.
Captain black. Trust me.
You're in terrible danger.
Jade is evil!
"I know she's a handful, Jackie."
But evil?
"Whee! Hee, ha ha! Whee!"
Duh...Smile for the camera.
Soon I shall devour your soul.
(Gasp)
P.A.: Melvin's world is now closed!
Please exit the park and see us again soon!
Finally! Aw...
"What do you say,"
stop off for an ice cream cone?
"Captain black, get away from her!"
"Whoa there, Jackie."
Grrr!
She's not really Jade!
The talisman's magic has made her a sheep.
"Oh, no, I mean, uh..."
I'll prove it!
What's the moose's name?
The name?
Grrr!
Give you a hint. Another word for wedgie.
"You can't name it, can you?"
You're evil! You're evil!
"Jackie, you look like you could use a little sleep."
Uhh! - Uhh...
Oh! Who are you?
Your executioner.
(Grunting)
Hey.
Stop that or I--
I give you a spanking.
As you wish!
This is not my body!
Weak little girl.
I am not weak!
Uhh!
"Come here, you!"
What are you--
hey! Stop!
You are so not fighting fair!
(Ring) Huh?
Busy!
"Uncle: Jackie, I found the <i> chi</i> spell."
Very good one.
Please put Jade on phone.
Aaaa-uhh!
It's for you.
Hello! (Speaking Chinese)
(Chanting in Chinese)
(Grunts)
Noooo!
I cannot break free!
Blasted <i> chi</i> spell.
"Shendu, back so soon?"
"And what, no talismans?"
Jade! Jade!
"Coming, Jackie!"
I'm back!
Jade...
It looks like we have lost a talisman to the dark hand.
Because of me.
I know.
But I guess it's because of you
that the rest are still safe in section 13.
Cool! So can we ride again?
"Hey, Jackie. - Yes."
Who do you admire and why?
"Oh, so many people I admire."
"Steven Spielberg, George, Lucas,"
the people of talent.
"They can use the computer, special effects,"
"not follow the tradition like me, you know, hurt myself,"
jumping off of real car.
"They can use the fake people, and they can use a--a dinosaur."
"Just choose part, doo doo doo."
"When I look at those kind of people, they really..."
That--those kind of people I really admire. Wow!
"Andrews, have a look."
I've never seen anything like it.
"I've seen you see something just like it, Nelson."
It's called a tortoise.
"No, no. Look here."
There's something encrusted onto its shell.
"Oh, my."
Whatever could it be?
Breathe deeply.
(Inhaling and exhaling)
"The breathe flows to the fingertips,"
then down to the toes...
Then the toes go up...
The bad guy's nose.
Hyah!
What? He was asking for it.
"Discipline, Jade."
"But I want to be a lean, mean,"
Jackie chan machine.
Don't be in such a hurry. Slow and steady wins the race.
"Chinese proverb, right?"
"Uh, Greek, actually. The story of the tortoise and the hare."
Once upon a--where you going?
Breakfast. Race ya!
Ahhh!
"Morning, Jackie."
"Hello, Kevin."
It's going to be sunny today.
I have to take your word for it.
"Newscaster: Today's weather forecast,"
clear and sunny with highs in the mid 80's for the bay area.
"Morning, Jade."
"Hey, Carlos."
And now for local events.
"This big fellow's name is aesop, and he's the star"
of the new galapagos island exhibit at the bay aquarium.
Tortoise? Talk about your coinkadink.
"The odd thing is, the aquarium's experts"
"noticed this little ""who knows what"""
imbedded in aesop's shell.
A tortoise and a hare?
Jackie!
What?
That!
"No, we are not getting a dog."
I saw a talisman.
It's on the tortoise's shell at the bay aquarium.
It had 2 long ears like a bunny.
The tortoise?
No. The talisman.
Huh. There is a rabbit in the Chinese zodiac.
I will investigate.
Cool.
While you're in school.
Aw.
Stop!
"Valmont, hey. New suite? Heh heh. Lookin' sharp."
Go back one.
Tohru.
"So there I was, flying the plane all by myself,"
"no co-pilot, and Jackie's hanging out"
the back flopping around
with no parachute or anything.
"Yeah, right. I bet the snake lady was there, too."
Viper? Nah. That was in New York.
Teacher: Jade!
Perhaps you can answer the question for us.
"Uh, that last question"
"or the one before it, miss hardman?"
The question you would have heard if you were paying attention.
Perhaps you need an extra-credit assignment.
Hmm. Dibs on the topic?
The rabbit talisman.
The question is how to remove it.
No need to worry about harming aesop's shell.
It's very durable.
"Uh, little girl, this area is off limits."
Little girl?
Jade!
You should be home. That's why they call it homework?
Uh-uh-uh. It's legit. Research.
I'm doing a report on aesop.
"Look, Jade, that really is a talisman on the tortoise,"
"and if you saw it on TV we can bet the dark hand did, too."
(Scoffs) Like bad guys watch...
Jade: TV.
Chan?
Go! Take Jade.
Ohh!
Ooh!
Uhh! - Ugh! - Eh!
Uhh.
Hyah! Ooh!
"Puh, pluh, ptooey."
Ooh?
Aah!
Hyah!
And I'm getting extra credit for this.
Whoop!
Uhh. Uh. Uh.
"Uh, ew, uh. Let go of me."
Ooh!
(Growling)
"Mm-mmm, uh, mm."
Aah!
Jade: Jackie!
The tortoise.
(Sighing)
"Jackie, what do we do?"
Mm-mmm!
Which way?
I'll make him talk. Whoop!
"Remember, slow and steady wins the race."
I like my plan better.
Yuck!
"Now, let's watch and learn."
"You know, shendu,"
these talisman expeditions--let's just say I'm racking up
some hefty out-of-pocket expenses and as of yet
there's nothing coming back into my pocket.
"When and only when your men acquire all 12 talismans,"
the lost treasure of chin chi wong
shall cover your expenses 10 thousand times over.
The reputed lost treasure.
Ahh. So we have a sceptic.
Aah! Ooh!
"Patience, valmont. Slow and steady wins the race."
"Ahem. Valmont, we scored the talisman."
Heh heh heh. And the team mascot.
You have the tortoise?
"When chan showed, we had to bail with the snail."
Prepare for a detour. I have an acquaintance
whom I'm certain will pay top dollar for our endangered friend.
"That's why you're the boss, ""v""."
Whoa! Getting another call.
Hello.
"Yo, ratso."
"Oh, well, sorry, dude."
Forget sorry. I need a ride.
Where?
Yeah. I can find it.
He's arranging to meet with the others.
Cool! Now we jump him?
"Keep low, he'll see us."
But this time wait for me!
Quick! Jump in.
Hey!
Jade.
Uncle?
Grr!
So how was school?
Peachy.
Aah. Peachy.
One more thing. Did Jackie find the rabbit talisman?
"(Growling) I am not Jade. I am paigon the powerful, ruler of the rabbit realm."
Ohh! Aah!
(Growling) I must fulfill my destiny
or the universe itself shall become <i> un-made.</i>
Release me at once.
"(Coughing) Man, that's rough on the throat."
We're outnumbered. Aah!
Don't you have a report to do?
Hello. Research? Need the tortoise.
Gentlemen.
Are you Karl niver?
Ni-vor. Dr. Karl nivor. In the flesh.
Who's this nivor guy?
Shh!
And this fellow must be the merchandise of which my friend valmont spoke.
"Mmm, yes."
"You're a fine specimen, aren't you?"
Aren't you?
The money!
"Boris, pay the man."
Care to join me for dinner?
"Thank you, no."
But we're having quite the delicacy.
"A dish so rare, you might say it's endangered."
Turtle soup.
Eww. He's gonna eat aesop?
Oh. He's gonna eat aesop.
Are you sure? Hmm?
"Yes, we, uh--uh--um-- must deliver this to valmont."
Ohh. Tohru has the talisman.
He's going to eat aesop.
"Well? The sooner you fetch a forklift,"
the sooner I may lift a fork to my lips.
Wait here.
Whoa!
Jackie! Where you going?
After the talisman.
But what about aesop?
You could choose another topic for your report.
Duh! This isn't about the report.
Aesop's going to be that creepy guy's din-din if we don't do something.
We will do something--
after I get the talisman. Follow me.
"But you never want me to follow you,"
and aesop's in immediate danger.
"Jade, we don't know what power"
this talisman possesses.
"If the dark hand gets it, people could be in danger."
"Oh, so you're ok letting something that looks just like uncle get eaten?"
Ohh! Where do you come up with these things? Huh?
Chan?
I thought I heard your voice.
Maim him.
Jade: Whoa! Jackie: Ooh!
Aah! Ohh!
Ha! Whoo! Aah! - Uhh!
Whoo. Grr.
Uhh!
Aah!
Ooh! Aah! Huh? Whoa!
Uhh!
Ooh! Uncle.
Where?
Eyah! - Ooh!
Tohru: Ooh!
Tohru!
(Fighting in plane)
Ooh!
Careful!
That one turns you into a chocolate bunny.
How did you get down there...So fast?
Aah!
Ooh!
Mmm...Peppy.
"Boris, that braised manatee you prepared last week"
was absolutely exquisite and the grilled American condor
on a bed of fava beans...
(Smacking lips) To die for.
Don't forget the carrots.
I'll be aft in the study.
Unh! Unh!
Uhh!
Who's a--
chocolate--
bunny--
now?
Hmm?
Uhh!
Whoa!
Big man can move.
(Growling)
Whoa!
Something's--aah!
Tohru: Aah!
Jade?
Jade!
Uhh! Come on. Come on.
(Meat locker shuts)
Stop!
Heh.
Pretty please?
A stowaway?
"Release aesop, you tortoise-eating creep."
Such a delightful child.
"She'll go well with a nice bernaise sauce, wouldn't you say, Boris?"
(Gasp) What?
"Only joking, Princess."
Children are much too common for my sophisticated palate.
Lock her up and get on with my dinner. I'm getting cranky.
Jade! Jade! Jade.
How like--
duh!
(Clanking)
Jade?
Jade!
"Jackie, I'm in here."
Whoa. How'd you go there to here so fast?
And now we'll save the tortoise.
See? Slow and steady wins the race.
But you have super rabbit speed.
I'm getting mixed messages here.
Oh--eh--uh--don't be smart.
Whoop!
"Valmont,"
"your men are supposed to find talismans, not sell pets."
Perhaps if you had given fair consideration
"to the advance I requested,"
none of this would have---
whoa. I did not know he could do that.
"I assure you, shendu, the rabbit talisman will be retrieved."
How right you are.
Kitchen's closed.
Uhh! - Jackie: Come on.
Unh! Ah!
Uhh! - Eh!
Ohh!
Uh-oh.
Out here?
"Ha ha ha. What's up, doc?"
What? How did you--
I want my dinner.
Whaa!
Whoa!
Jade and doctor: Huh?
<i>Vamoose!</i>
What?
Uh...Welcome?
I don't have it.
Charge!
Huh? Oh!
Jade: Wahoo!
Ah! Anyone for leftovers?
"Boy: Oh, come on! A turbo turtle?"
Faster than a speeding rabbit.
No way!
Way!
"Yeah, right."
"I bet that super strong ox guy was there, too."
Jade: El toro? Nah. That was in Mexico when I was flying the plane.
"Boy: - Hey, Jackie, do you like to watch television?"
Yes. I learn so many things on television.
"You know, my English I learned from the TV."
"I like education channel, discovery channel."
Even cartoon I can learn something.
I want TV.
I'm only in Hong Kong.
I can watch what's going on in Morocco.
"What's going on South Africa and Europe, everywhere."
And really learn a lot of things I don't know before.
"Even training, I watch TV."
TV is my teacher.
I love TV.
"Cough up some cash, twerp."
B-but today's fishsticks.
My mom says I need the protein.
Aah!
Can't eat if you don't got a face.
Be afraid.
Megabully strikes again.
"Hey, maynard."
Let go of him.
"Beat it, shrimp."
Shrimp?
"Let it go, Jade."
Unh.
"Put the lunch money down, maynard."
"Hey, there's enough here"
for fishsticks and pie. Aah.
Ooh. Ooh.
That's gotta sting.
"My mom always told me not to hit girls,"
"but in your case,"
I'll make an exception.
Gulp.
"Fair warning, maynard:"
I am trained in - the ancient art of butt whup.
"-Yeah, right. -Zip it, drew."
Go on.
"What you gonna do, shrimp?"
Grr...
Hyah!
Unh.
Whoa.
Aaahhhh...
That would be Ms. shrimp to you.
[Cheering]
"All right. Go, Jade."
What is going on here?
Jade just smacked maynard munson down.
"Uh...Ms. Hardman,"
I can explain.
"Perhaps it's time I had a chat with your guardian, young lady."
Uh...Uncle Jackie's...
Not reachable.
He's on a business trip.
Aah!
Ooohhh...
Unh.
Ahh...Whoo!
Good for the pores.
Heh. Enter the dragon...
Exit Jackie chan.
Aah!
"Stay cool, hot stuff."
"[Pants] Bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day."
Yaah!
Very bad day.
"[Hissing] Valmont,"
where is the dragon talisman?
"My men are on it, shendu."
"Your men could not find their own shadows,"
and your incompetence
continues to stupefy me.
Oh? I'll stupefy you!
"Temper, valmont."
The arrogance of that oversized lawn ornament.
"Valmont, check it out."
You actually did your job?
Imagine.
You're not stoked?
I'm absolutely giddy.
[Gasps]
Whoa.
Puff the magic dragon.
Whoa. Whoa.
And that's when valmont's men
escaped with the talisman.
You didn't follow them?
They could've led us to valmont himself.
Ach...I was a little preoccupied.
"Captain black, the dark hand has the dragon talisman."
If they discover the magic it possesses...
"Uh, I said the ""m"" word, didn't I?"
Jackie! I missed you so much.
You look like you had a rough day.
"Can I get you a cup of tea, maybe some cookies?"
New shoes?
"Jade, what did you do?"
Jade is in trouble at school.
"Cup of tea sounds good, thank you. One more thing--"
your place is too big.
I have to walk very far to find a bathroom!
"Uncle, what are you doing here?"
Landlord made me leave the shop for 3 days.
Says it must be sprayed for bugs.
This is how I spray for bugs.
"Yes, siree, it's a real family affair"
here at section 13.
"Jade, what kind of trouble at school?"
Ms. hardman just wants you to come to a parent-teacher conference.
No biggie. Heh heh.
"Sir, the U.S. mint's under siege."
Patch me into their surveillance.
What about tea?
Valmont.
Mobilize!
Let's rock. Unh.
"Jade, you are not a secret agent,"
and we have a previous engagement.
Remember?
[Sniffs] Hmm...
Hot off the press.
What? It's laundry money.
Company.
Valmont.
"The dark hand waves bye-bye, captain black."
"Mr. chan, this is not the first time we've had a problem with Jade."
"The swinging from gym lamps, stilt walking with ladders,"
scaling the building with a fire hose.
Just like Jackie!
He reminds me of a chimpanzee.
Uncle!
"Ach. Now, I don't know where Jade learned to fight--"
from Jackie.
He's a good teacher.
"Uncle, shh."
"Ms. hardman, I assure you,"
"the martial arts - are meant to discipline Jade, not teach her to--"
"martial arts, like karate?"
Kung fu.
The best self-defense.
Whole body becomes a secret weapon.
"Well, you obviously don't provide Jade"
"with enough discipline, Mr. chan."
So I will have to.
A whole week's detention?!
What a rip.
"Jade, maybe now you will remember"
that the greatest victory
is the battle not fought.
Unless it is fought
against bugs. Yaah!
"Uh, yes, and in your case,"
that means watching your temper.
But he called me shrimp.
[Cell phone rings]
Jackie. [Gasps] No!
"The doctors say he's lucky to be alive,"
if you call that lucky.
Valmont used some sort - of advanced explosive device.
Powerful stuff.
The dragon talisman.
Who sent these?
Valmont.
Grrr...Aaaahhh!
"Simmer down, Jackie."
I am sorry.
I just...Saw red.
"Valmont, you were da bomb!"
Pun totally intended.
"Hey, ain't old dragon breath"
gonna start wondering where his rock is?
Pity. It's doing wonders
for our cash flow.
"One more heist, big v?"
One for the history books.
[Bell rings]
"Hey, Jade."
Greatest victory battle not fought.
Greatest victory battle not fought.
Unh.
Hyah!
Don't hurt me.
You're not looking for revenge?
I want you to teach me
the ancient art of butt whup.
"T'ch, so you can be a better bully?"
"Dream on, maynard."
The martial arts are...Uh...About
finding the strength within
to discipline oneself.
That-that's me.
"I lack discipline, really."
Free your mind of all thoughts.
"Aiyaaa, there is no privacy here."
"I put my bao in the refrigerator, and somebody ate it."
Focus only on your breathing.
Your breathing is slow...Deep.
One more thing:
How is your friend captain black doing?
Grrr...Hyah!
[Panting] I...I need some air.
[Inhales]
Ahh...
[Alarm sounds]
A big rig was just blown to bits
by a well-dressed gentleman.
Where?
"Route 64, outside corydon, Indiana."
"Speeding distance from fort Knox, Kentucky..."
And the U.S. gold reserve.
Mobilize.
I'm going with you.
"Uh, Jackie, you're not a secret agent."
"You're an archeologist, right?"
"I know that, Jade."
I'm just going to retrieve a talisman.
His anger clouds his judgment.
I noticed.
[Muffled explosion]
What was that?
This is a restricted area.
Official business.
I need to speak to your commanding officer.
And you would be with?
Section 13.
Who?
The grass is always greener
on the sunnyside of the gopher hole.
Was that always there?
I don't know.
"Faster, tohru."
And lift with your legs.
[Grunts]
A shame captain black
won't be visiting today.
I understand he had a doctor's appointment.
"Yeah, doctor's appointment, I get it."
Grr...Aah!
Aah. Ooh-ooh.
Chan.
Aah! Unh.
Ohh!
Jackie chan.
Finally we meet.
It was nice knowing you.
"Man: Still waiting clearance, over."
Captain black was lucky.
But my aim has improved with practice.
Unh. Ohh...
"Uh, you want the other talismans,"
"don't you, valmont?"
Continue.
I will make you a deal.
Show you where section 13 is.
Was that always there?
Uhh...
Aah...Yaah!
"Why, you little shrimp."
Grr...
Hyah!
I'm working on it.
Unh.
Ow!
Respect your elders. Unh!
"Uncle, how do you spray for bugs?"
Oh...Like--
"ow! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
One more thing.
Guh!
"Hey, big bully!"
Eat heavy machinery.
Whoa!
Ratso!
"Whoa, Jackie!"
Ow!
"Heh. Hello, driver's ed."
Unh.
"Uncle, what are you doing here?"
Making sure you do not lose your temper
and do something foolish.
"T'ch, good job, uncle."
"Valmont, where are you?"
Valmont!
Something is amiss.
Find valmont.
Find my talisman.
Wait here.
Jade.
But valmont's still dragon-powered.
How is Jackie gonna take him down?
By not fighting.
Aaaahhhh!
Glug glug glug.
"You really go for the gold, Mr. chan."
Fool's gold.
"You know, valmont,"
I was wondering--
what is one of these worth?
An all-expenses-paid trip to Melvin world?
You'll pay for that.
What about these?
A new Ferrari?
Chan.
A Summer home? Your own private island to build it on?
A robot Butler for that home?
Rraahhhrr...
Blast.
Jackie.
[Coughs]
[Coughs]
A little help.
"Uh, boss, visitors."
"That was bad, right?"
"Heh. Take it easy, boss."
"The doctor says you can leave in a few days,"
if you rest.
"Sir, good to see you up and at 'em."
Salvage operations recovered the bullion from the river bottom.
Valmont?
Which means that dark hand
still possesses the magic talisman.
"Jackie, the ""m"" word."
But you saw it.
The dragon power injured you.
I had valmont in my sights.
Ahh...The rest is a blur.
Ohh...
"Shendu, I beg your forgiveness."
"You may earn it, valmont."
Rumor tells of a talisman
at the north pole.
Dress warmly.
Ahh...
Free your mind of all thoughts.
Focus only on your breathing.
"Gimme the basketball, chump."
"Make me, double-dribble breath."
"Ach, don't you two know"
that the greatest victory is the battle not fought?
I make such a good Jackie.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, what did you wanna be when you were young?"
When I was kid?
"When I was kid, I wanted to a rich man."
And then I wanted to be a hero.
Fireman. Policeman.
Sometimes I wanted to be a president.
All kinds of things
I know in the real life I cannot be.
So that's why now I really like to be a movie star.
Why? Because I can do whatever I like to do in the movie...
Just by being myself.
Yes.
Sold for $200.
The next item up for auction is a porcelain lamp
"featuring, well, an unusual rat motif."
What am I bid for this piece?
$100.
Do I hear 150?
200.
Smashing. Do I hear--
250!
-300. -350.
-4! -500.
-6! -7!
-8! -9!
"1,000."
"2,000."
"That's all I got, tohru."
Think they take nunchucks?
"$2,000."
Going once...
Going twice...
Sold for--
aah!
"I'm sorry. I'll send you a check, ok?"
Huh?!
Unh! Oh!
This building should be condemned.
Whoa-oh!
Unh!
Hmm...
Hey! My hat!
This area's restricted!
We're blowin' up the--oof!
Whaaaaa!
Yes! Yes!
Noooo!
"Another train wreck, Jackie?"
"Uh, I was going to ask you the same thing."
Do baboons live here?
"Jade, you must learn to clean up after--"
"you've got it, Jackie-o."
"Tell ya what-- - I'll clean the whole place,"
"and you can reward me with, oh..."
"I don't know,"
a turbo troll?
You already have one of those.
Uh-uh! I have gnomekop.
"Turbo troll is his mortal enemy,"
"and if I get both of them, they'll fight each other."
"Everyone's collecting them, Jackie."
"Can I please have one, please?"
"Mmm, we'll talk about it when you finish cleaning."
[Chuckling to himself]
Gnomekop: Gnome power!
Jackie: Oof!
[Gasps] Gnomekop!
Must find turbo troll.
Must find turbo troll.
"[Sighs in relief] It's ok, Jackie."
Nothing's broken.
Oh-ohhhh...
Jackie?
Ooh! Ah!
Ow! Ooh!
Run down the side of an exploding building--
no problem!
"But step on a child's toy,"
break your bones.
Wah ha ha ha!
Sounds like a Chinese proverb...
Oh! It's all my fault.
Huh! Jackie is young and strong.
He will heal quickly.
"Accidents happen, Jade."
But do you now see the importance of tidiness?
"I'll make it up to you, Jackie."
I promise.
How's my patient?
"Ha! According to uncle,"
strong enough to do his research.
"Hey, who knows? Maybe this rat"
is the heal-a-broken-leg talisman. Hmm.
All tidy. Not a toy in sight.
Gnomekop: Must find turbo troll!
Must find turbo tr--
[nervous laugh]
The power of the rat
brings motion to the motionless.
Hmm...
Need anything?
"Uh, no. Thank you."
Warm up your tea?
I just need quiet so I can concentrate.
I'll just fluff your pillow.
Ooh!
Nice and fluffy.
"Uh, Jade,"
I can take care of myself.
"Remember, within every weakness lies strength."
"Whatever you say, Jackie."
Here. Let's just move you a little closer to the desk.
Oww! Sorry!
Waa-aah! Aah!
Jade: Sorry!
Turbo troll!
Towels! Towels!
Belt blaster!
Jade: You sure you're ok?
"I'm fine. Ah, where's the talisman?"
[Gasps]
Man on p.A.: Full alert! Intruder in the compound!
Full alert!
"And when we came back,"
"the lock was melted,"
and the talisman was gone.
The dark hand-- they've located us.
"Black to vault, report!"
"Condition blue, sir."
The other talismans are secure...So far.
"This is all my fault, too."
If I hadn't spilled that stupid tea...
I'm gonna find--
gnomekop?!
Must find turbo troll!
Whoa.
Who goes there?
You've never said that before.
"Come here, you. Hey!"
Jade!
-Aah! -Whoa!
"Leg, leg..."
"Jackie, something's wrong with gnomekop. He's--"
"please, Jade. I've had all the gnomekop I want for one day."
-Jackie! -Gnome power!
Ohh!
Aah! Whoa!
I know where you live!
That toy should be taken off the market.
I tried to tell you.
He's not just a toy anymore.
He's alive! Alive!
"Oh, what do you mean, he's--"
[gasps] Motion to the motionless.
"Weird talisman power, huh?"
"We found nothing in the debris, master."
The rat talisman
"is the key to my freedom, valmont."
It will reanimate me into flesh and blood.
Ooh. You mean you'd get back
all your dragon powers and stuff.
No. Shendu will still require the other talismans
and our continued assistance for that.
"Judging my experience,"
"I will remain in this petrified state forever,"
and you will never lay your eyes
on the lost treasure of ching shian.
2 words--
mouse hunt.
And the talisman must've dropped inside
"and transformed the toy into a living, breathing thing."
"Jackie, when you fell,"
did you hit your head?
"Captain black, look!"
"Yeah, he was right behind you."
"Of course he was, Jackie."
"Jade, no!"
Gotcha! Unh!
[Embarrassed laugh] Loose thread.
All gone.
"Thank you, Jade."
Gnomekop: Must find turbo troll!
Turbo troll...
[Jackie and Jade grunting]
That phone booth is not wheelchair accessible.
"Oh, you! Don't move!"
Unngghh!
"Stay back, Jade."
"No, Jackie. You have a broken leg."
And gnomekop is my responsibility.
Eee-yeow!
Got you!
Belt blaster! Whoa!
Aah!
Sorry.
Stop.
Gnome power! Unh!
[Gasps]
Jackie!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Jackie!
"Brakes. Brakes, brakes, brakes!"
-Whoa! -Whoa!
Whaaah!
Oof!
Oh. [Panting]
Whew.
Gnomekop?
I can't escape you.
[Gasps]
"Hang on, Jackie!"
Sorry. I'll bring it back. Thank you.
Jackie!
Unh!
How's the leg?
"Where is turbo troll, scourge of the elfin realm?"
Uhh! Enemy mine!
"There he is, Jackie!"
Jackie?!
Unh! Unh! Coming!
Turbo troll?!
[Gasps]
A battalion!
Why would he come to the mall?
Maybe he's a mall rat?
Gnomekop: Must destroy turbo troll!
[All shouting at once]
Grrr! Rrr!
Gnome power!
Ohh! Come on!
"Conceal me, brothers."
"Oh, my gosh! Turbo troll captured the gnome Princess!"
That cad will pay!
Gnome power!
He's crazy. He could hurt someone.
Yeah! Like you!
[Yelling]
Aah! Oof!
Jackie!
Huh?
[Struggling]
Troll armies are amassing.
Gnomekop must be liberated!
What is it going on about?
Turbo troll is gnomekop's archenemy.
"See, the emperor of troll castle hates gnomes"
"'cause gnomes possess magic from the great crystal,"
so gnomekop uses his power belt to...
[Nervous chuckle]
"I, uh, collect 'em."
Shendu: Enough of sprites and fairies.
"The talisman, valmont."
Yaaugh!
Gnomekop escaped the bald-headed giant's fortress.
He will escape you as well.
Baldheaded giant?
Could he mean captain black?
Does it matter?!
Give me the talisman!
"Shendu, if this gnome escaped from section 13,"
then perhaps it can lead us there.
[Hissing sigh]
The other talismans.
"Mighty warrior, we just received word that turbo troll"
has claimed the baldheaded giant's fortress
as his stronghold.
Aarrrhh!
I will have his head!
No sign of him.
Sure does a lot of damage for a runt.
Jackie!
[Sniffing]
He's going down--
whoa! Shh!
Look.
He's retracing his steps.
But they'll follow him back to section 13.
I'll warn captain black.
You do that.
He'll love the part about the dark hand
teaming up with a magic gnome.
"Well, do you have a better idea?"
Remember that turbo troll I've been wanting?
Jade: Psst!
Yaah!
Turbo troll rules!
Must destroy turbo troll!
You sure Chucky ain't lost?
Jade: Yaa-aa-aaugh!
Aaarrr!
Here he comes.
[Grunting and groaning]
[Nervous laugh]
"Oh, no!"
Turbo troll is near.
You wanna sign my cast?
Leave him alone!
He's disabled!
Waaah!
Ohh! Jade: Jackie!
[Gasp]
"Have a nice swim, chan."
Hope you haven't eaten for an hour.
Jackie!
"You, fan boy..."
The doll.
[Sniffing]
Turbo troll is near.
Argh! Unh!
Hey!
Gnome power!
Here he is...
And there he goes.
Huh?
Whoa...Wha?
Ow! Ow! Grrr! Grrr!
"Hang on, Jackie!"
[Panting]
Jade!
Jade?
Aah!
Oh! Ow! Grrr! Grrr!
Whoa.
Whaaah!
[Whistling]
"Here, boy."
Gnomes can't swim.
"Jackie: Jade, remove the talisman."
Argh!
"Unhand me, giant!"
Oh-aaah!
Jackie!
Whoa!
Gnome power!
Waa-aa-aa-aa-
aa-aa-oh!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Oh. Unh... Unh...
Not again.
"Your majesty, king of gnomes--"
-come here! -No!
I'm sorry. I'll bring these back. Thank you-ooo!
Gotcha! Ooh!
Gnome power!
Aah!
No way.
Where is turbo troll?
In his pants.
Must destroy turbo troll!
No! No!
No-o-o-o-o!
Run away!
We must retrieve the talisman.
"You're kidding, right?"
"Jade: So while Jackie distracted giant gnomekop,"
"I climbed up top, crawled inside his mouth,"
and got the talisman.
"You did very well, Jade."
"Yeah, except for the part where I slipped and fell off"
and landed on Jackie.
Oh...
Agreed.
Oh!
Puuh!
Jackie is young and strong.
He will heal quickly.
"Hey, Jackie, have you been seriously hurt doing your own stunts?"
"Yes. So many times. My eyes, my face,"
shoulder...
Nose 3 times...
"Elbow, elbow..."
Cannot remember.
"My jaws, knees, knees."
"Cut. Ankle, ankle."
All of my teeth gone.
I hurt. Cannot remember. Cannot remember.
"But most important, you remember."
Don't do any dangerous stunt at home.
Only in the movies.
"You're not gonna get away with this, chan."
"Hey, hey, hey! Where you goin'?"
"""Hey"" is for horses."
"Speaking of which,"
I'm the winner by a nose.
Chan!
Aah!
Hunh!
After him!
Chan jacked my gear!
Snowboard!
¶ Da da da da da ¶
huh! Unh!
"Aah, uhh!"
"""Quiet! Avalanche zone""?"
Unh!
All: Shhhh!
"¶ Da da da, fum fum fum fa ¶"
"guys, wait up!"
Quiet.
What?!
Be quiet!!
[Rumbling] Ooh.
"Ooh, mama."
All: Whaaaa! Whoa!
Hmm?
[Grunting and groaning]
Living large...
Extra large.
"[Coughing, sneezing]"
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Ah-ah-choo!
Cover your mouth.
[Shivers]
"Big ""v,"""
you th-think you could turn up the h-heat?
Shendu: Allow me.
That's plenty.
Much obliged.
"Careful, shendu."
"If you charbroil the help,"
they'll never find the next talisman.
"The next talisman is insufficient, valmont."
I need all 12 to shed this petrified form
and regain my true powers.
"We are working on it, shendu."
With your customary ineptitude.
"Once again, this chan has snatched a talisman"
from your so-called professionals.
[Coughs]
Too bad chan ain't workin' for us.
Hmm.
Perhaps he can be persuaded.
Level one security card?
Check.
[Buzzes]
"I punched in your birthday, captain black."
"Invalid code. Nice try, though."
It's not polite to hack into security systems
that don't belong to you.
I saw a 7!
"Whoa, slow down, little lady."
The entire floor is a sensor field.
Shall we put horsey in the stable?
You mean the talisman?
You didn't bring it?
"Uh, no."
Uncle's still trying to research what magic...
It has.
"Heh heh. Uh, uncle and his crazy hobbies."
[Beeping]
[Buzzes]
"""Namsilat?"""
"Talisman spelled backward, duh."
"You get an ""a"" for effort, smarty pants."
But not only is section 13 top secret...
It's impenetrable.
Shendu: This potion should accommodate
"your needs perfectly, valmont."
"Then by this time tomorrow,"
chan will have no choice
but to work for the dark hand.
Now for the bait.
I have translated the inscription
on the back of the talisman.
A very perplexing riddle.
"""If activated, the noble horse"
"expels all alien forces within."""
Hmm.
I bet those alien forces inside the talisman
fly out and latch onto human brains
and turn people into mind-control zombies
to conquer the world.
"Eh, the alien forces signal the mother ship"
to launch an invasion?
This isn't the martian talisman?
There is no such thing as martians!
The talismans are magic.
[Cell phone rings]
Hello?
"Jackie, the mainframe located another bogey."
Pack your toothbrush.
"You're going to mount rushmore,"
south Dakota.
I'm on my way.
Let's rock.
"Uh, uncle needs you."
"You, uh, you were this close"
to solving the riddle of the talisman.
Let's crack that code.
Unh!
Uhh!
The talisman couldn't be in the gift shop?
Ahh.
What big eyes you have.
"Don't blink, Mr. president."
Huh?
The snake talisman?
We already got that one.
Ye-aah!
Ohh.
Oh-ohh.
Valmont.
Upsy-Daisy.
"Ooh, snake bite. Could be fatal."
You bring me all the way out here
to poison me?
"A rather appropriate lure, since the venom"
now rushing through your veins
will soon turn you to stone.
Just because I believe in magic talismans
doesn't mean I am gullible.
Visual aid.
"In 12 hours, Mr. chan,"
you shall be among the statuesque.
The venom takes 12 hours to fully infect humans.
"Fortunately for you, an antidote does exist."
"I can provide you with that antidote, Mr. chan."
What's the catch?
An exchange of goods:
The cure to your affliction
for the talismans in section 13.
"Should you decide you're interested in my offer,"
you may rendezvous with my men
"at coit tower in exactly 11 hours, 52 minutes."
And don't forget the talismans.
Ugh!
Where is the antidote?
You think I'd be foolish enough
to bring it with me?
Uhh-aah!
Uh-uh-uh.
Need those talismans.
Ulp.
Ach! Urgh.
Ech.
"Ah, so it begins."
"Time is a-wasting, Mr. chan,"
and it's a 2-hour flight back to San Francisco.
You're turning to stone?
I have until 6 A.M.
Valmont's men will be waiting
with the antidote at coit tower.
Wh-what are we gonna do?
The riddle of the horse talisman can wait.
I will make an antidote.
"But, uncle,"
we don't know the formula.
Bah! Mine will be just as good.
Swallow.
"[Coughs, gags]"
That's the antidote?
No. Fermented beetle larva is good protein.
[Dripping]
Drink.
"[Gulp, gulp]"
Oof.
Gee-heh. Ach!
Gee-yee-aah.
Jackie: What? What is it?
Nothing.
Don't--don't look in the mirror.
What? Aaaaaah!
I told you not to look in the mirror!
Oh! I am a lizard!
I will become a stone lizard!
Uncle: See? Reptiles shed their skin.
No problem.
"Uh, did the antidote work?"
"Eh, huh, ach!"
Jade: Guess not.
Maybe captain black could get
the section 13 doctors to help.
"Pfft, modern medicine has no power"
over ancient spells.
I will make another antidote.
-Jade: Jackie? -Aah!
"Jackie, you have to give the talismans to valmont."
I can't.
"According to the legend,"
the power in each talisman is nothing
compared to the power of all 12 combined.
"But if you're all turned to stone,"
who's gonna stop the dark hand
from getting the talismans anyway?
That's captain black's department.
"I'm just research, remember?"
"Jackie, please!"
I don't want a Boulder for an uncle.
"Captain black,"
I need a ride back to section 13 for Jade.
It's past her bedtime.
Ok. If that's the way you want it.
It was 3 digits ending in 7.
"3 digits, 7?"
"Captain black, I got your number."
The only way to save Jackie is Jackie-style.
I have a new antidote.
This may sting.
Unh!
Hmm.
[Cell phone rings]
Yes?
She what?
Caught it all on tape. Jade's made her point.
She can be an agent when she grows up.
Now tell her to return the goods.
"Yes, I will tell her."
"[Coughing, sneezing]"
Valmont had to pick the draftiest place in town.
[Sniffle]
Should've called in sick.
Could I bum a tissue?
"All right, you sickos."
Let's get down to business.
Ain't it past your bedtime?
[Chuckles] Where's chan?
Never mind him.
I've got everything you want...
Right here.
Well?
How do I know
that antidote's the real deal?
That'll work.
Ah-ah-choo!
The talismans.
"Jade, don't!"
Aah-ohh.
"I have to, Jackie."
You're running out of time.
Thank you.
[Gasps] No!
Oh-aah? Unh.
[Laughing and coughing]
One is missing.
No way!
I cleaned out the vault.
[Gasps]
I forgot the horse one at uncle's.
"Um, if you give me the antidote,"
I really for sure promise to get you the other one.
Scout's honor?
"Tsk, like she's a scout."
Noooo!
Why?
Ah-choo!
Because chan makes me sick!
Jackie.
"Don't worry, Jade. Uncle will come through."
We don't need your stinking antidote!
Unh! Uhh! Unh!
[Panting]
"Unh, oh, uhh."
[Clunk] Ow!
Ooh.
Aah!
Grrr.
"Oh, aah."
"Oh, that doesn't hurt at all."
"Unh! Hey, give me that!"
"Unh! No fair! Hey, stop it!"
Jackie!
Uncle!
You found the antidote?
No. I brought the horse talisman
to trade for their antidote.
Both: Ohh.
One more thing: I also brought
the antidotes that did not work.
Maybe if I mix them together.
Aieeeyaaa!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-choo!
Gesundheit.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
Uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh!
Uhh-uhh-urr-uhh-uhh-uhh!
[Crash]
Tohru: Ow.
"That ought to keep him,"
unless this is the sprout-wings-and-fly talisman.
Both: Get her!
Jade!
The dark hand will-- ooga-ugh!
Never have--gulp!
All 12...
Jackie!
A dollar says his hand'll snap right off.
Deal. Deal.
You stay away from him!
"Oops. Uhh, unh!"
"Heh, heh."
Uncle: 2 more things...
[Growls]
Both: Hey!
Aah! Aah!
Oof! Oof!
Aah!
"Oh, Jackie."
He was very brave.
"I miss him, uncle."
He left a fine memorial for us:
Looks just like him.
[Sniffles]
We could put him in the garden.
Or outside the shop to ward away evil.
[Thumping]
[Takes deep breath]
Ahh.
"My cold is gone, like magic."
"""The noble horse expels all alien forces within."""
The riddle!
It doesn't mean aliens within the talisman.
It means aliens within the sick person holding the talisman.
The horse is the healing talisman.
Think it only works on colds?
The talisman.
How'd tohru activate it? How?
Ah-choo!
Hey.
Hey!
Hyah!
"Aroo-uhh-uhh, uhh-ugh-uhh."
Uhh-uhh-urr-uhh-uhh-uhh.
[Crash]
Tohru: Ow!
Jackie!
Ohh.
I told you I would bring the antidote.
You must never question uncle!
Thank you both.
"Now, we have some talismans to return."
"I've got some explaining to do, huh?"
We will just tell captain black
we were between a rock and a hard place.
Heh heh.
"Boy: Hey, Jackie,"
do you have a favorite color?
My favorite color:
"White, blue--light blue."
Green is good.
As normal as possible.
"When I look at the sky-- all blue, all white:"
So beautiful.
"Sometimes for the movie I'm wearing a red,"
"pink, uh, purple--"
I don't like that. Mostly I like white.
"White means calm, gentleman, nice person and handsome."
How much is that doggy in the windmill?
Ha!
"Hey, good boy!"
Tohru: Chan!
The ta-- talisman?
"Uh, what talisman?"
The one the dragons indicate.
Oh! This talisman!
Grr!
"You know, tohru,"
you really should consider
coming over to the good side.
"Section 13 has a marvelous dental plan,"
and every Thursday is donut day.
Unh!
Jackie: Whoa! Uhh!
Unh! Grr!
Argh!
Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a nice day!
(Seeker turns off)
Chan!
Aah! Unh!
(Seeker malfunctioning)
Hmm?
Time to walk the dog.
(Telephone ringing)
Jackie: Hello?
Jumping jackal? It's me...Fearless hyena.
Jade? Shh!
Wise old goat roams near.
What?
Ancient rabbit has very long ears.
What are you talking about?!
It's uncle's birthday!
Where are you?
Ugh! My flight had a layover
in Bavaria.
If I never see Bavaria again--
"jackal, this isn't about you."
"Don't worry, Jade."
My plane will arrive in plenty of time
"for ""operation: Surprise"""
"cool! So, what did you get him?"
Uh--
p.A.: Flight 19 to San Francisco
is now boarding.
"Uh, that's me! See you soon! Bye!"
"Chocolate, cheese..."
Lederhosen? Oh!
Bavaria!
(Hip-hop music playing on radio)
Jade? Jade!
Jade!!
Ugh!
"Uncle, you scared me."
And the rock and roll noise
is scaring away the customers.
"Tsk! It's hip-hop, duh!"
"Come on, uncle coolio. I'll teach you some moves."
Ugh! My hip does not hop.
Sure it does.
You just gotta move with the grandmaster groove.
Ohh!
(Uncle moans)
Ohh!
I am like that antique.
"Uh, valuable?"
Old and brittle.
"Jade & Jackie: Happy birthday, uncle!"
Jade: Heh heh!
I was all possessed that day
but my hair looks good.
"And, uh, hey, funny moose!"
"I will Cherish it, Jade."
What did you bring me?
Jackie: Ta-da!
"Oh, chocolate stains my teeth,"
and cheese makes my--
"um, none of your business."
Uh--oh!
I brought you one more thing.
It's your sign.
"So how old are you, uncle?"
"Jade! Er, in dog years?"
I will do research now.
"But, uncle, we have cake!"
You have to celebrate!
"When I am - another year younger,"
then I will celebrate.
You failed to retrieve the talisman...
And you sat on this.
Shendu: The seeking device was forged by magic.
Such things are hard to come by.
"Apologies, master."
Perhaps the time has come
to have a freelancer lead future missions.
"No need, master."
I will do better.
"Ahh, too late."
"Tohru, meet hak foo."
"Hmm, black tiger."
He does not look so ferocious.
(Growls)
Angry crow takes flight!
Hyah!
Emu stands on mountain top!
Monkey plucks 2 peaches!
Ye-ahh.
"Uh, looks can be deceiving."
"""The dog talisman is best friend to man:"
"""It restores youthful energy to its holder..."
"And grants eternal life."""
Hmm.
Immortality.
"Jackie, has uncle always been, like, all,"
"you know, uncle-y?"
"No, Jade."
"When uncle was young,"
he was just like me.
"Does that mean you're gonna be grouchy,"
"constipated, and smell like garlic"
when you're uncle's age?
"Oh, Jade, respect your elders..."
Both of us.
Whaa!
What? What is it?
A talisman...
Made of chocolate.
Jackie: The pig is one of the signs
of the Chinese zodiac that we haven't yet located.
And these ferkel's chocolates
are clearly modeled after the pig talisman.
So once again I am off to Bavaria.
I could use a change of scenery.
I will go with you.
Awesome.
"No baby-sitter means I get to go, too."
"B-b-b-b-but, uncle,"
you never leave the shop.
And what about the dog talisman?
"Bah, research can wait."
Hyah!
Whoa.
Ha-cha-cha-cha. So...
What are we waiting for?
The mainframe indicates
that one Mr. chan has purchased
3 airline tickets to Bavaria.
The dark hand jet awaits.
"Uh, tohru, be a sport and tag along"
in the event hak foo requires your services.
And when you meet our friend Jackie chan?
(Growls)
Smashing melon fist!
(Oompah music playing)
"I will do some sleuthing at the chocolate factory, Jade,"
but I think it's best that you stay with...
Uncle.
"You know, Jade,"
they have hip-hop here in Bavaria.
Really?
Yes. They call it oompah.
Hmmph!
"So, uh..."
Where shall we begin our search for the talisman?
I don't know.
"<i>You</i> sat on - the seeking device, remember?"
Ahem. Well...
The only talismans left to be found
are the tiger and...
The pig.
Remain here and stand watch--
and I mean <i> stand.</i>
Less chance you'll break something.
(Growls)
"You see, Mr. chan,"
great great grandpapa ferkel
devised a unique method
of melting mass quantities of cocoa beans.
But grandpapa was a superstitious man
and took the secret to his grave.
"So, all the modern equipment you see around you"
"performs essentially the same task,"
locking in wholesome chocolatey goodness.
"(Yawns) Oh, interesting."
Grandpapa was also a very generous man
and donated the clock tower to the town.
What can you tell me about the pig?
"Elwin? Oh, ho ho."
Everyone loves elwinschwein.
Grandpapa considered pigs to be his lucky animal.
No one quite knows why.
Perhaps because he found a pig talisman?
I'm sorry?
"Uhh, nothing."
And I thought your hip didn't hop.
Ha-cha-cha-cha. Uncle.
Hello! Cheese?
Yummy.
But cheese gums up your...
Something's different about you.
"Eeh, like what?"
"Well, for one thing,"
"you haven't said ""one <i> more</i> thing"""
since we got here.
Uhh...
"Come on, uncle, please."
You can tell me.
No way.
Way.
"Uncle, - that is so cool."
"It's giving you the power to,"
"uh, be cool and stuff."
"You're gonna keep it, right?"
(Thinking) Hmmm.
(Clock chimes)
Jade & uncle: The talisman!
Hak foo: Seeking a talisman?
Only counterfeits here.
Do I know you?
I am hak foo:
The last human - you will ever lay eyes upon.
Mantis boxing style! What?
Serpent pounce technique!
Float like lotus blossom!
What are you talking about?
Sting like scorpion! Aah.
Unh!
Flamingo stance.
"Oh, these little piggies went to the market."
Flying dragon corkscrew!
Cat lands on feet and bares claws!
Cat shakes off water.
Cat tears squirrel's head off!
Aah!
Ooh!
Baboon leave tuccus exposed.
(Hak foo snarls)
Hungry crane diving for shrimp!
(Jackie groans)
Black tiger crushes chan.
"You, tiger man..."
Remove your feet from Jackie.
What's a Jackie?
Take your leave or feel the burn.
"You talk the talk,"
but can you walk the walk?
"Uncle, this guy beat Jackie."
(Hak foo growls)
Monkey plucks 2 peaches!
Huh?
Whoa.
Gorilla snaps frail twig!
"Guh-oh, whoo-hoo."
"Twig may be frail,"
but roots are slippery.
Jackie?
Uncle?
Rabbit punch!
Mule kick! Lobster claw!
Cobra coil! Oyster shuck!
Duck stomp!
Ow.
(Babbles)
Grrrr.
Angry crow takes flight!
"Thank you for sharing, angry crow!"
"Jade, uncle just leapt 20 feet into the air."
"Go, uncle!"
(Growls)
Hmmm.
Elephant thrusts its leg!
Baaah!
Both: Uncle!
Heh heh.
I meant <i> fist.</i>
Both: Uncle!
"Jackie: Uncle, are you ok?"
Jade: Say something.
"Retire from talisman hunting, chan."
It is a hazardous occupation.
Jade & Jackie: Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle's voice: Uncle!
Uncle!
"Yes, uncle?"
What happened? - You got such a whupping.
Big mouth had a big fist.
One more thing:
There's work to do.
You must acquire the pig talisman
and discover the power it possesses.
But I am dead.
Aiyaaa!
How can you be dead?
You are wearing the immortality talisman.
"Oh, right."
One more thing...
(Smack)
Ow!
"Uncle, you're ok!"
"Err, see?"
Lots of garlic is good for you.
We must get the pig talisman
before the big mouth finds it.
But we don't know where it is.
"Oh, yes we do."
See the oinker at 12 o'clock?
Elwin's sportin' a pork pie hat.
We saw it earlier when the clock chimed.
"Huh? Oh, ooh."
Tohru!
Many thanks...
For leading us to the prize.
You are not welcome.
You!
But elephant fist!
Why so afraid?
He is an old man.
Uh-yuh-uh- yuh-uh-yuh!
3 against one. We can take him!
"Jade, the talisman."
"Uh, right."
"You, family-size,"
stop the girl! Sit on her!
Do something!
Grrrr!
Tiger slaughters 2 lambs!
You've been working out.
Pfft. Like riding a bicycle.
Unh! Uh!
Unh! Uh! Unh! Uh!
Going up.
Whah!
(Gasps) Jackie!
Give me...
That.
The lucky pig was how grandpapa ferkel
melted his cocoa beans.
Heat-beam eye-blast?
Heat-beam eye-blast!
(Clock chiming)
Time is not on his side.
(Scoffs)
Freelancer.
Heat-beam eye-blast.
Hak foo: Ow.
Save Jade!
Both: Bwaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaah!
Whoa! Aaah!
Unh!
Huh. Oh.
(Panting)
Whoo-eee.
I will just go fetch the pig talisman
while I am up.
Uncle...
Explain.
"Jackie, thank you for allowing me"
to re-experience my youth.
But being young is too dangerous
and exhausting!
Uncle needs a nap.
"You earned it, uncle."
"See, Jade?"
"As tohru demonstrated,"
one cannot turn back the hands of time.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie?"
Yes.
Do you know how to cook?
Yes.
I know how to cook an egg
and also a lot of fruits
and water and juice
and...Noodles.
Anything quick.
"Scrambled eggs, sunny-side up,"
and I can cook toast.
And all kind of eggs.
Actually I am a terrible cook but I love to eat.
If you ask me that's my answer.
"I know you're all excited about career day,"
but your parents won't be arriving
until last period.
"Hey, Jade,"
is your uncle Jackie gonna wow the class
"about the ""secret agent"" business?"
"You bet, drew,"
and the truth is gonna
blow...Your...Mind.
"Oh, oh, you mean the ""truth"""
"about ninjas, magic talismans,"
that 400-pound giant named tofu?
His name is...
(Thundering footsteps)
Tohru.
(Muttering) (Muttering)
Jackie. Uncle.
"Jade, hand over the talismans..."
Or we chop down your family tree.
You guys are the ones going down.
Hyah!
Hyah!
"I'm sorry - I doubted you, Jade."
No homework for the rest of the year!
"Yes! Go, Jade."
"Yeah, no homework."
Jade...
Jade...
Jade!
"If you're done daydreaming,"
can you tell us the capital of Italy?
"Uh, pizza?"
Heh heh.
"So, with the kitten under one arm,"
"and the orphan under the other,"
I leapt out of the second-story window.
"Yeah, I saved a few lives,"
"but when you're a firefighter,"
that's all in a day's work.
"Thanks for listening, kids."
All right!
(Cheering)
"All right, dad."
"Pretty cool, drew."
But wait till you get a load of Jackie.
"To uncover artifacts,"
the patient archeologist
digs in the dirt
"with little, tiny brushes,"
bring very careful
not to damage anything.
Sometimes it can take
hours or even days.
So much for secret agent man.
Uh...Question?
"Jackie, tell us about the time"
you whomped a bunch of shadowkahn
on the roller coaster at melvinworld.
"Heh. That's a bit off topic, Jade."
"Now, once an artifact is unearthed--"
really! He tanned their ninja hides.
He's got amazing reflexes. Watch.
Ow! Jade...
"Jade has quite an imagination,"
"doesn't she, Mr. chan?"
"Heh. Yes, she does."
"And a good throwing arm, too."
(All talking at once)
"Thanks, Jackie."
"You made me look like a big, fat liar."
"Jade, my work with section 13"
"is a secret, remember?"
"Besides, this is career day,"
and my career is archeology.
"Next time you go on a mission,"
I'm bringing back proof.
What next time?
"You're not supposed to go on assignment with me, Jade."
"And don't forget, children--"
"next week, it's your turn"
"to report on your parents' job,"
after you accompany them to work.
Jackie: Captain black
has pinpointed the location
of another talisman
in Micronesia.
Whoa.
You think archeology
is a snore?
We'll start here.
"Remember, Jade--"
archeology requires Patience.
Ooh...
"Oh, Jackie..."
You gotta be kidding me.
It's the monkey talisman.
Must be a sea monkey.
The dark hand.
"Go, go, go!"
Get back up to the boat.
Aaahhh!
Unh. Unh. Aaahh!
(Panting)
(Gasps)
The talisman.
Ah...
"Hand over the rock, flipper."
Hey.
(Grunting)
"Uh, you guys are going down."
Stop.
Why are we listening to him?
Yaaahhh!
(Grunts)
Whoa.
"Get off of me, ratso."
Rrrrr....
Jackie!
Monkey magic better be good.
"Come on, activate already."
Uhh...Before this boat ride
makes me yack.
Whoa. Not what I meant.
What just happened here?
Chan's a horse.
"No, chan's a yak."
The talisman.
"Uh, yakkie, er, Jackie?"
"Uh, change him back."
"This must be the ""turn stuff into other stuff"" talisman."
I noticed.
So how about I turn tohru into--
(all scream)
(Jade groans)
Ohh...
(Screeches)
Ewww!
Hello. Mouthwash?
Who are you?
Where am I?
Ah...I'm shipwrecked.
My report is gonna rock.
"Say ""cheese."""
(Screeches)
"Hey, monkey boy,"
"that's not for you,"
even if it does have your picture on it.
"Oh, no. Jackie."
(All groan)
Ahh...
"Tohru, hiya."
"Yeah, hiya. Hiya."
We must find the talisman.
How do we know chan and the girl aren't still at sea?
Jade: Jackie!
"Oh, Jackie!"
Jackie!
There she is.
(Gasps)
Jackie.
Jackie!
Ohh...
Jackie...
Jackie...
"Jackie, you are shipwrecked."
"Yes, uncle, shipwrecked."
One more thing--
Jade has the monkey talisman.
Jade's a good girl.
One more thing--
bad men are chasing her.
She needs your help.
Now! Ow.
Jackie!
Jade.
(Panting)
"Duh, the ""turn things into other things"" talisman."
Turn this log into a death ray.
Waah! That's a manta ray.
Change it back! Change it back!
(Pants) Guess it only does animals.
"In that case,"
how about I get these rats off my tail?
Ratso?
(Squeaks)
Whoa.
The talisman. Huh? Right?
(Panting) Aardvark. Hippo. Giraffe.
(Thud)
(Panting)
Gotta hide. Gotta hide.
Double duh.
Make a monkey out of me.
(Screeches)
Where'd she go?
"This way, I think."
"Whew, close call."
"Ok, change me back."
(Screeches)
Not good.
(Animal growls)
Way not good.
Aaaaaahhhhhh!
(Snorts)
"Hello, Jade."
You're a monkey.
Nyah-nyah.
Aah!
(Hisses)
"Hey, I don't get it."
She just disappeared.
(Screeches)
"Yo, talisman at 9:00."
A monkey's got it.
Grab the chimp.
"Hey, Mr. muggs."
"I've gotta get that talisman back,"
wherever it is.
Jackie: Jade!
Jackie.
Jade.
Jade!
Jade!
A giraffe?
We drifted all the way to Africa?
(Gasps)
Jade.
Tohru.
(Screeches)
Aah! Aah!
"Jackie, those dark hand guys were after me,"
"so I turned myself into a monkey,"
and then this other monkey took the talisman.
(Screeches)
Shoo. Go away.
Duh. Monkeys don't speak English.
"Ok, first word--"
sounds like...
Maid.
"Uh, you seem like"
"a very nice monkey,"
but I have to find my niece.
Wait. Don't go.
(Screeches)
I'm not going to take your picture.
Yes.
(Screeches) Me!
Jade? You...
You know where Jade is?
"Oh, an arrow."
"Oh, thank you,"
little monkey.
No.
(Screeches angrily)
Hey! Put me down.
Jackie!
(Screeches)
Jackie!
(Screeching)
Let me go. Let me go.
"Hey, whoa. What are you doing? Eww!"
"Eww! Check, please."
(Screams)
"Guess that means ""bye-bye"" in monkey."
Heh. Guess not.
Oh...This is the last time
I follow directions from a monkey.
Don't move.
Stay right there.
"That's it, bonzo."
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
(Screeches)
Hyah! Stop.
The monkey.
Gaah. Where is Jade?
(Squeaks)
Ratso.
That's ratso?
(Squeaks)
"Tell me what you've done with Jade,"
or ratso gets it.
"Ohh, calm down, dude."
"We were chasing her, that's all."
"The kid zapped ratso,"
"and the next thing we know,"
that monkey had the talisman.
Jade turned ratso into a rat
and herself into a monkey?
I'm a monkey's uncle.
Jade!
The girl's the monkey with the talisman? Whoa.
(Squeaks)
(Screeches)
Aah! Gaah! Unh.
(Screeches)
Hmm. (Grunting)
Jade!
"Oh, Jade."
"Here, Jade."
It's me. Jackie.
"Ach, Jade."
"Yo, Tarzan."
Unh. J--
"Jade, quit fooling around."
Stop it.
I don't need a bath.
(Screeches)
"Later, mom."
Jade.
(Screeches)
"Sorry, Jade."
This is for your own good.
Change her back.
"Jade, did you break the talisman?"
Hand over the rock.
Here goes nothing.
Ooh.
Hey there.
Talisman works just fine.
Ratso: I say we turn him into a dog. I like dogs.
Why would you wanna turn him into something you like?
"A cat, then."
"Ah, cats are too snooty."
How about a cockroach?
We can stomp him.
An emu.
Yeah. What's an emu?
Don't know. Sounds good.
Perhaps an animal we can eat.
Hmm...Chicken a la chan.
No! That would make you cannibals.
(Angry screeching)
Change me back.
"Hi, Jackie."
Jade. Then who are you?
(Belches)
The talisman.
Elephant.
"Aah, Jade! Bad move, bad move, bad move."
"Uh, got it covered."
Once a rat...
(Squeaks)
Jackie. Change him back.
"Hey, gimme, gimme, gimme."
Gaah!
You're a flamingo.
Kangaroo.
Huh?
Good choice.
Change me back.
Jack-- rabbit.
Unh.
(All grumble)
(Screeches)
Change me back.
Hope this means what I think it means.
Aaaahhhh!
Aaaahhhh!
(Angry screeching)
"Hey, cut that out."
(Screeching)
(Sniffing)
Ooh-ooh.
"Hi, mom."
Mom?
Welcome to the family.
Ms. hardman: Now it's Jade's turn
to give her report.
"Ahem. On my day at work,"
"uncle Jackie and I went scuba diving for artifacts,"
"but a big storm kicked up,"
and we wound up shipwrecked.
"Yeah, right."
And there were these monkeys and...
Ahem.
"To uncover artifacts,"
the archeologist
digs in the dirt
"with little, tiny brushes,"
being very careful
not to damage anything.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie,"
do you have any pets?
I love pets.
"Very, very good for the human."
If your partner is your friends--
"if you have a pet, you have him with you every day."
"I remember long time ago,"
I have 3 Saint bernards. Big dog.
I love big one.
"The problem is, all those years,"
I been traveling around making movies.
"6 months later, when I coming back,"
"I said, ""nuh nuh nuh,"""
he bite me. He don't listen me anymore.
So it's no good.
"But later on,"
"when I retire, settle down, yes."
(People murmuring)
The tiger talisman
is inside one of these pies.
"Pfft. Piece of cake-- er, pie."
We just join the contest and eat till we find it.
"And the beauty is,"
Mr. green jeans is our only competition.
(Footsteps approach)
Uh...
<i>Was.</i>
(Evil laugh)
Maybe tohru didn't leave room for desert?
(Tweeet)
(Slurping)
(Crunch)
Somethin' crunchy in my pie.
Thank you!
Ahhh!
Gimmie that ta--
"he was gonna say ""pie,"" right?"
Wha--?!
Grrr.
Huh?
47 pies!
A new record!
"After 9 centuries,"
"all 12 talismans have been recovered,"
"yet I possess only 2,"
while Jackie chan has 10!
"You have failed me, valmont!"
"Now, shendu,"
just because chan's locked them away in section 13
doesn't mean we won't find them.
The new year approaches!
It is essential that I have all 12 talismans before then
if you ever wish to lay eyes upon the treasure of <i> o'in shi'huang.</i>
Tohru!
Bring me Jackie chan.
"He will surrender the location of section 13,"
with proper prodding.
(Buzz buzz)
Chinese new year rocks!
Especially the sweets.
Jackie: Jade.
2 more days till new years.
Aww.
Hot cha!
"Jackie, the tiger talisman"
possess the power of balance.
Cool!
"So, whoever has it can't lose their--"
whoa!
The kind of balance your parents in Hong Kong sent you here to learn.
Within each and every one of us lies conflicting forces:
"Yin and Yang,"
"light and dark,"
good and evil.
Like <i> Jackie</i> àhas a dark side.
I do. Her name is Jade.
Ba-dum-pum-tch!
Balance?! That's not even a real power.
"Good. I will enjoy taking this powerless talisman to section 13,"
so we can put this quest to rest.
While Jade will enjoy making tea for her dear old uncle.
Rrr.
Huh?
Cracked?
How did...?
(Crunch)
Ahh.
Whaa?!
Whoa!
Whew. Mirror.
Oh! Where's the other half?
(Crunch)
(Crying) Uncle!
What is it?
I stepped on a bug!
(Crying)
"Tea is ready, dear uncle."
(Gasps)
Mmm. Good.
Jackie!! That's <i> my</i> candy!
Not any more. Got milk?
What happened to Jackie?
He is such a crybaby!
He's such a jerk!
He is in the library weeping all over my research!
"No, he's in the kitchen, raiding the fridge."
Jackie? Jackie?
Whaa! Whaa!
(Braaaack)
Whaa! Whaa!
Hmm...
"When the talisman broke,"
Jackie's yin was separated from his Yang.
Whoa.
Jackie-lite and Jackie-dark.
I am the dark side.
I murdered a bug!
You're the side who ate my candy?
You're evil! Eviiiil!!!
Not evil.
Just lacking sound judgement
without his good side to guide him.
"So, each of you has half of the talisman?"
Good.
You must join them together
to reunite into one Jackie.
Me and wimpy?!
"Oh, please, no!"
"He burps out loud without saying ""excuse me""!"
You must restore balance!
But--ow! But--ow!!
Ow!
"Oo, you will pay for that!"
Ow! Oh!
Uh...Jackies?
(Growls) (Whimpers)
The dark hand.
Hide the talisman!
What are we gonna do?
Laugh like circus clowns while they scream for mercy.
Run!!
Guess we'll never know if 2 jackies
are better than--whoa!
This is no place for children!
"Chan, you're coming with--"
oh!
Hey. You didn't even let him finish.
(Crack)
(Crack)
Ahh! Whoa!
Fighting is not nice.
Get him!
"Jackie-lite is still packin' Jackie moves,"
"but I bet he's gonna need some ""Jade dark"" to balance him out."
Men: Ow! Ugh! Ow!
Seem like chan's in a particularly bad mood today?
You mean the psycho?
He copped my jacket!
"Oh, who cares? Look what I copped."
Hey!
Grrr.
Run! Totally run!
Uncle: Hiyeee! Hyah! Hyah!
Grrrr.
Ahhh!
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Huh. He'll never catch us.
Weren't <i> we</i> supposed to catch <i> him?</i>
Shut up.
(Imitates guitar playing)
It's him!
Ahh!
Here. Take it.
"What, and spoil my fun?"
This better be good.
Ahhhhhhh!
Ahh!
(Gasps)
Chinese new year rocks!
Half a talisman?
"It's a start, I suppose."
Now tell me the location of section 13 or--
(vidphone rings)
What is it?
We got chan.
Valmont: I know. He's right here.
He is?
"No, he's not. He's right here."
"Oh, hello."
How are you?
The tiger talisman is the glue
that binds the conflicting powers
of all the other talismans
into one unified whole.
"If it was divided by chan,"
it is likely that chan himself is divided
into light and dark.
"So, which chan do we have?"
"And when the fish hit the road,"
"you guys all went, ""bwaaa!"""
(Laughing)
"Ya know, chan, you're all right."
Yeah. Too bad we gotta eliminate you.
Eliminate me?
(Door opens)
"Shh, shh. It's big ""v."""
Valmont: Perhaps there is another option.
"Bring me the talismans from section 13,"
and I will make you rich.
Works for me.
Get in there.
Are those seats real leather?
"Oh, those poor cows!"
(Jackie sobbing)
(Gunfire)
Section 13! They're shootin'!
Get down!
(Fireworks popping)
"Jade, this is terrible!"
"I know, I know. I shouldn't be playing with fireworks."
"Yes, that's very true."
"But even worse,"
those bad men captured my other half!
"We need section 13's help,"
"but if captain black sees you,"
he's never gonna believe there's another you
who needs rescuing.
"So you have to wait here, <i> capiche?</i>"
Uh-huh. Good.
"Now, hand me your half of the talisman"
so I can put it in the vault for safekeeping.
Captain black!
The dark hand captured Jackie!
What?! We've got to--
"you almost had me, scamp."
(Humming)
But I'm serious! He's in trouble!
"Now, now, Jade."
I just saw Jackie.
"Look, there he goes again."
Heh heh.
You totally blew it!
I told you to wait outside!
Cool jacket.
Get your mitts off it.
Grrr.
Why are you being such a...
Jerk?
Brother!
You're ok!
"Oh, are you going fishing?"
Went.
Talisman fishing.
Oh! You're a bad boy.
And you're ugly!
"Now, where's the other half of the tiger?"
"Oh, that tickles!"
Ugh!
Aah!
Ugh.
"Ok, meanie! What are you--"
was I mean to you?
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
What are <i> you</i> àdoing down here?
I told you to wait outside.
The bad me - stole the talismans.
"Most of them, anyway."
You gotta stop him!
"I tried scolding him, but--"
"I mean ""stop"" him!"
You know...
Hyah! Aiyyee! Hyah! Hyah! Aiyyee! Hyah!
"Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Fighting is not nice.
Rrr.
Wait!
You can't do this!
"If the dark hand gets all the talismans,"
"then something really, really bad is gonna happen!"
So?
"But you're not evil, remember?"
Uncle said everyone has yin <i> and</i> Yang.
You can't be <i> all</i> Yang.
Yang-dang-doodle. Doobie-doobie-doo.
Jackie.
(Jade growls)
Hyah!
I liked these.
Oopsie?
Hyaaah!
Hyaaah!
"Ah, ah, ah."
It's not nice to drop-kick little girls.
"See? If he has a fighting side,"
"then you've gotta have a, er, nice guy side."
"Once I give these to valmont,"
I'll have a rich guy side.
"Give me that, you little gnat!"
"Ah, ah, ah! Name-calling is not nice, either."
Jackie-lite may need a little magic back-up.
(Straining) Come on! Come on!
"Ooh, let's get you an icepack for that."
(Vidphone rings)
Any sign of chan?
No.
Then get off your tremendous behind!
I want those talismans!
"Yes, master."
(Straining)
(Pants)
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
Smarts.
I <i> like</i> the burn.
Ahh!
Hyah!
"Oh, I got you all dirty."
(Strains)
Yes!
These are not the talismans!
Let me go!
Help!
Jackie!
Jade!
Too bad. I kinda liked her.
She's scrappy.
Oh! She's family!
We have to save her!
We do?
You'll get to fight more bad guys.
8...9...
10 and 11.
Yes. I can feel my power returning.
The statue talked?
You guys are working for a statue?
Quiet!!
11 1/2.
What?
Valmont and shendu: Where is the other half?!
(Whistles casually)
It's always tohru's fault.
Everyone blames tohru. Huh?!
"So, which one's on our side again?"
Jackie-dark: Black's not my color.
(Elevator music plays)
(Crack)
(Crack)
Come on down.
Can't we get along?
(Straining)
"No! Stop, please! Stop! (Laughs)"
"I said ""please."""
The chans are in the building.
They do not possess the missing half.
"Well, it must be--"
somewhere.
"Hey, you have pretty decent chops for such a big baby."
"Oh, I owe it all to teamwork."
Don't touch me.
Jade: Jackie!
Stop him! He has all 12!
Stop! Stop!
Hy--! Hy!!
"Game over, chan."
<i>Way</i> over.
I live!!!
Rrrrrrrrr.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie?"
Yes?
What's your favorite junk food?
My favorite junk food?
My favorite junk food...
Ice cream
yum yummy.
I love ice cream.
"Chocolate,"
"vanilla, strawberry."
"That's all. Mostly I like ice cream,"
but after I ate ice cream today--
chocolate--
"more punching, more kicking."
Ow!
Let's go to eat some ice cream.
Previously on Jackie chan adventures...
The new year approaches.
It is essential that I have all 12 talismans before then.
"Narrator: When the talisman broke,"
Jackie's yin was separated from his Yang.
"Bring me the talismans,"
and I will make you rich.
Works for me.
The bad me stole the talismans!
Jade: Most of 'em anyway.
"Wait! If the dark hand gets all the talismans,"
"then something really, really bad's gonna happen!"
Ooh! Oh!
I...Live!
"At long last,"
my powers...Restored!
"Speed, invisibility,"
astral projection!
That thing's why valmont wanted the talismans?
And my personal favorite...
Combustion!
Aah!
Jackie!
Aah!
Aah--huh?
Whoa.
Oo-ooh! Ah-ha-ha!
Jacki-I-I-ie!
Grab my legs!
Whoo!
Call captain black!
"Once I reach the top,"
you head for the bottom.
Aw!
Whoa!
Shen-dude!
Uh...Welcome to earth?
Good to see ya up and around.
"Well, the office is a shambles,"
but the lost treasure of q'in shi'huang
should more than cover the cleaning deposit.
"Regrettably, valmont,"
you did not provide me with the talismans.
Jackie chan did.
A technicality.
Read my lips...
No treasure for you.
Tohru...Make this deadbeat pony up.
"You go, bro."
"Yeah, we're right behind ya."
In spirit.
But master--
do it!
Hee-ahh--
w-uh!
Need I remind you
that I possess the power of levitation
and super-strength?
Uhh!
All: Whoa!
(Huffs) Fine. Treasure's yours.
Aah!
You...
All: He ain't even singed.
"That, gentlemen, would be our cue."
Too bad about the lost treasure of...
"You know, whatchamacallit."
Will this affect our bonuses?
You get a bonus? Shut up!
Surprise.
Come on!
Who--what are you?
I am...The keeper of the talismans.
I am the apocalypse of which legend speaks.
And I am... For once and for all
your executioner!
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Aah!
Aah!
Uh--oof!
This way!
Jade...Please explain.
I think it used the power
of the levitation talisman combined with the speed talisman
so it could fly.
What? What did all that so it could fly?
Got me.
But it used to be a statue.
Did the demon have any specific markings?
"Red eyes, great big claws,"
and razor-sharp teeth <i>isn't specific enough</i> <i>for you?!</i>
(Growls)
Thousands of demon sorcerers
have existed throughout history!
I need more information--
"a symbol, a name,"
anything!
Chan!
Oh! Go away! We have no more talismans.
The demon's name...
Shendu.
"Uncle: ""Shendu was the evil warlord of a vast kingdom."
"""He was imprisoned by his subjects,"
"""and the 12 talismans from which he drew his powers"
"""were scattered to the winds."
"""He vowed to return one day,"
"""not only to resurrect his palace"
"""but to conjure dragon minions"
"""to wreak his vengeance upon the descendants"
"""of those who rebelled against him..."
"""By destroying..."
"All of Asia!"""
(Gasps)
Mom...Dad.
Shendu's former palace
is located near what is now Hong Kong.
"His vengeance is to begin at the toll of midnight,"
ushering in the Chinese new year.
Chinese new year? That gives us only a couple of days.
Less. Hong Kong is 16 hours ahead of San Francisco.
We'll take section 13's fastest transport.
Finding the demon is not enough.
One must have a means of...
Defeating it.
Thank you.
I will come with you.
I will come...(Grunts)
Too.
Um...That's ok.
Tohru...Why help us?
I am told section 13 serves donuts on Thursdays.
"I am sorry, but you must stay."
No.
Ow!
You stay here! Someone must watch the shop!
Good.
Now...Let me gather some things.
Well...Whaddaya say we save some lives?
"Jackie, I <i> have</i> àto come with you!"
I'm an essential part of the j-team--
the cunning one.
"Jade, this is not a movie."
You know that. This time it is too dangerous.
Hmmph!
(Jackie sighs)
Your mother and father will be safe.
I will see to it.
And I will see to it that he sees to it!
Don't let your guard down.
"Jade's, uh...Cunning."
"Oh, guard!"
"Tell me, why hasn't jolly captain black"
graced us with his presence of late?
I so miss his good humor.
Black's in Hong Kong on a...(Laughs) Demon hunt.
I see...
"Big v, what-- what are you doin'?"
Raising cane.
(Water running)
What the--
I gotcha!
Huh? Psst!
Guards: Hey! Let me out! Open up! (Pound on door)
(Alarm)
Whoa. Jackie was serious about me not going.
Valmont's escaped!
Seal all exits!
(Clanging)
"Voice: This way, I think."
Goin' to treasure island.
Treasure island... Hong Kong.
Uncle: Go away! I am busy!
Uh...You've been in the lavatory since takeoff.
That is right! Laboratory!
Do you want Jackie to defeat the evil demon? Yes?
Then go away! Let uncle work!
"Don't worry, mom and dad."
I'm coming.
The palace!
Where?
Here...Where the inscriptions indicated.
Look...It's almost midnight.
Oh! Whoa!
What is it? An earthquake!
Never question the inscriptions.
Whoa! What is that?!
"What is shendu doing, uncle?"
Releasing his dragon minions.
Let's turn up the heat.
No! Shendu is immortal!
Magic must defeat magic.
Men...
"Jackie, this balm will enable you"
to penetrate shendu's demon shell
and remove the talismans.
Remove? All 12?
"Not if you are cunning, like Jade."
Certain talismans offer shendu not firepower
but sustenance.
"For example, without the reanimation"
"that the rat talisman provides,"
shendu would revert back to being a statue.
"Shendu: Soon, my warriors."
Midnight draws near.
What?
(Grunts)
The sheep talisman.
How many lives do you possess?
"Sheep, sheep, sheep. Which power was that?"
Huh?
Oh! The astral projection talisman!
Of all the useless-- what am I supposed to do with that?
He's out cold. Men...
No! Magic must defeat magic!
(Groans) Ah...
(Inhales)
Mmm. Fresh meat!
Huah! Huah!
My talismans!
"You cannot harm me, chan."
The horse is the healer.
Ohh...Uhh...
And the rabbit is speed.
Buaah!
That tears it. Men!
Uh--ohh...
Who else wants a piece of uncle?
Chan better keep Rex the magic dragon busy
long enough for us to line our pockets.
Jackie!
Monkey? I was hoping for--
rabbit!
Cute.
(Gasps) Invisibility!
It's the Chinese zodiac hit parade!
"Monkey see, monkey do!"
The strength talisman.
Good one.
"I know, Jade."
Whaa--Jade! How did you--
your hands!
I get it! That must be some uncle magic!
(Gasps)
Ughh--talk later!
At last!
"Well, boys. Let's dig in."
The playing field... Is almost even...Shendu.
"You may have the ox,"
"but relative to me,"
all that makes you is a very strong mouse!
No! Mom and dad...
All of Asia are counting on you!
And me!
Pity you will not live to witness my reign
over your world.
But you shall be the first to visit theirs.
Eee-yah!
What--da--
little Jade horner...
Pulled out a dog.
Rat!
No-o-o-o!
(Cheering)
What happened?
See?
What have we learned?
"All, annoyed: Magic must defeat magic."
"I <i> will</i> have my revenge,"
if it takes another 900 years.
Tch. No rat means you're just a statue.
And no dog means you're not immortal.
But the talismans!
Never mind!
No-o-o-o!
"Happy new year, Jade."
"Happy new year, uncle."
Ow!
You destroyed the demon yin and Yang.
Now the world is out of balance!
Nobody told you to destroy the demon!
Jade did it.
Now there is a void for a new...
Stronger evil to fill!
(Coughing)
"I know how much the treasure meant to you, big v."
But how 'bout a consolation prize?
You should visit your parents.
They...Might want me to stay with them.
Would that be so awful?
Tch...For you.
Uncle!
"Come, Jackie!"
Give tohru a hug!
Don't.
This...Will take some getting used to.
Ahh...This and Jade not being around.
(Sighs) I know.
Ah! That reminds me!
A letter from Jade's parents arrived yesterday.
They are very pleased with how much she has learned in America. Ahh...
One <i> more</i> thing...
"They're <i> so</i> pleased, they want me to hang here for another year!"
Jade!
Jackie!
"Jade: Hey, Jackie. Do you think you'll act"
for the rest of your life?
"I know...I cannot always on the...In front of screen,"
"but I can be a director, a producer,"
help the people how to editing all the action scene.
A writer. Some other things I really don't know.
"Only thing I know is, uh...Film."
I will be in the film industry all my life.
It would seem we have lost
the lost treasure of q'in shi'huang.
"On the bright side, however,"
Jackie chan has done me a tremendous favor
by eliminating my albatross.
Albatross?
Thought shendu was a dragon.
Which means we now have exclusive access to...
Some very potent magic.
Jade: Jackie.
We can't move back to uncle's.
It reeks in there--
like mung beans and mothballs.
And it's totally boring.
"Jade, you say <i> boring</i> àlike it's a bad thing."
Aw!
Jackie!
Uncle! We're moving back in.
Ow!
You cannot move back!
Why not?
Where will tohru sleep?
You've been jacked.
"Oh, well. Guess we'll just have to stay"
in our supersecret underground base.
"Jade, there's no reason for us to live"
in section 13 anymore.
Are you sure about that?
"Valmont's still at large, remember?"
"I am an archeologist, not a secret agent."
What about the talismans?
"Buried in the earth,"
along with shendu and his palace.
But what makes you so sure
"we've seen the last of the big, bad dragon?"
"Once I make Jackie chan pay,"
I shall tear that buffoon valmont to pieces.
Silence!
"The only future you have is here, with us..."
Brother.
Indeed. Let the eternal torment begin.
Torment?
Eternal?
"To punish your betrayal, shendu."
You chose to spend your time ruling China.
While we withered in this bone-dry pit.
"Bored out of our wits all those centuries,"
each exactly like the one before it.
You never even attempted to free us.
Uh...
"Your rescue was in the planning stages,"
but I became imprisoned in a statue.
Excuses!
You desired the earthly realm
for you alone.
Gaaah!
"A shame you never learned to share, brother."
No! Wait!
I...Can free you.
Do not toy with us.
The doors can only be opened from the other side.
The human side.
Precisely.
"As the humble spirit you now see before you,"
I am free to cross over
"and possess any human I wish,"
enabling me to undo the sacred spells
which keep you here...
If you so deem it.
"12 talismans,"
4 enforcers--
3 each.
"Uh, boss?"
There's only 3 of us
since tohru cashed in his frequent-flier miles.
So I'll just hang on to these.
Hungry crane spear fish!
Agh!
(Growling)
Everyone remembers hak foo?
"Ha ha. Hiya, hak."
"Or do you prefer ""foo""?"
Valmont: <i> Master</i> foo.
The black tiger shall be your new lieutenant.
Jade: Ooh!
Section 13 is so cool.
Careful.
Positronic shock wave will atomize your brain.
"Hey, kepler. Whatcha workin' on?"
"Solid-state, particle-beam-driven,"
"high-density, hypnosis-inducing phase shifter."
2-speed.
"Uh, sounds complicated."
(Chuckles)
Hardly.
Ooh. When are you gonna finish your jet pack?
Whoa!
Yesterday.
(Humming a tune)
Jackieee!
"Not now, Jade."
I'm bus--Jade!
Whoa! Hey! Ohh!
Waaah!
"Jade, what are you-- talk later!"
Sorry! Sorry!
Whoa! Waah!
Ceiling! Wah!
Whoa! Whoa!
Jackie: Make it stop! Make it stop!
Oh. Stop.
Whew! Whew!
Yaah! Yaah!
Unh! Uhh!
Heh. Talk now?
"Jade, you should never play with things"
you don't know how to work.
I didn't know I didn't know.
Now I do.
"Well, perhaps now you <i> know</i>"
why we have to leave section 13.
But tohru will have nowhere to sleep.
I found a very charming apartment for us.
"They allow children and pets,"
"but no secret agents, dark hand thugs,"
or magic talismans.
(Alarm sounds)
Jackie! - Robbery in progress.
Financial district.
It's the dark hand.
Uh...Good luck with that?
They're packin' heat--
talisman heat.
(Explosion)
Aah! Aah! Watch out! Help!
Me strong like ox.
Freeze!
Ooph! Ohh!
Watch out.
Snake in the grass.
And this little piggy went to market.
Hyah!
Astral projection?
Motion to the motionless?
Yin Yang?
How come I get all the loser powers?
Mule kick. Hah!
No fair. You're not even using yours.
The horse for healing?
I am not easily injured.
The rooster for levitation?
I already fly.
The dog for immortality?
There is not a man alive who can vanquish me.
It's cool.
Trade ya.
Baby.
Score!
(Alarm)
Movie it! Move it! Move it! Move it!
Go! Come on!
"I know you're eager to get on with your life, my friend,"
but you know more about these talismans than anyone.
But--
"I need you, Jackie... One last time."
(Sighs) One last time.
"Just when you think you're out,"
they pull you back in.
So can I--
no. No.
(Grunts)
Didn't even let me ask.
"And if I didn't ask,"
how am I supposed to know what they said no to?
Ahem!
"Hey, kepler, how does this work?"
"Ignition, steering, throttle, brakes."
<i>Grazie.</i>
Ha ha! We're like superheroes...
Who steal stuff.
(Loud rumbling)
Freeze!
Step away from the vehicle.
Hyah!
Here's lookin' at ya.
"Oh, look, ma-- no hands."
(Out of breath)
Bad day.
"Shendu: So, I trust you would agree"
"that my, uh... Martyrdom"
has left a void
"for a new, stronger evil to fill--"
"namely you, - my brothers and sisters."
"Shall I proceed, then?"
What trick is this?
"You have proven crafty, brother,"
so we require a safety measure.
Our spell will keep you bound
within the human of your choosing
until you release us.
A precaution so that we know exactly
where to find you.
In the event we deem it necessary
to resume your eternal torment.
I accept your terms.
I will choose my vessel well
"to best serve you,"
and the human most capable for this task
is my Nemesis-- Jackie chan.
"Ooh, rabbit for speed."
Immortality <i>and</i> healing?
That's redundant.
Ooh!
(Moaning)
I'll swap you.
Take Mr. ed.
"Hey, my headache's gone."
You dirty <i> rats!</i>
Let's go! Go! Let's move!
"That'll do, pig. That'll do."
"All agents, fall back!"
Repeat: Fall back!
One last time.
"Jackie, I said fall back! That means you, too!"
I'm not an agent.
(Gasping for breath)
Need a lift?
I told you never to play with things
you don't know how to--
"ignition, steering, throttle, brakes."
(Stammers) Faster.
Whoa. That is weird.
Lose them.
Can't tail what you can't see.
Whoa! Huh?
It was worth a shot.
Jackie!
Aah! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Heads up! Aah!
(Gasps) Look out!
"Yeah, like - I'm gonna fall for tha--"
(groaning)
Immortality hurts.
Chan!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Get your mitts off of me!
Blast him!
Walrus!
Walrus?
Change him back.
(Cell phone rings)
What is taking you so long?
"Uh, flat tire?"
Yaaah!
You seek the talismans?
One on one.
2 on one.
2 1/2.
(Engine revs)
Aaah!
Black tiger crushes bald eagle.
Ohh!
(Moaning)
Angry crow takes flight!
Ye-aah!
Bye-bye. Have a nice day.
Uh-oh.
Payback time!
"Jade, what are you doing?"
I can take him.
I can fly!
No! Jade! <i> Jade!</i>
Stop!
"Well, well."
Hyah!
Oof!
(Moaning)
Huh?
Gas? Kepler never mentioned fill-ups.
Jade!
Jackie: Jade!
Valmont: Hyah!
What?
Oof! Unh!
(Shendu's voice) No!
Aah!
(Both groaning)
(Grunting)
No!
Trapped within this proven failure of an Ally.
(Groaning)
All the more reason to hasten my quest.
(Gasps) No.
We have more important matters to attend to. Get in!
We'll just grab the loot and--
no loot! Get in now!
"Really? Sore throat, boss?"
You don't sound too good.
(Groaning)
(Valmont's voice) Why are you standing there?
Collect the cash!
But you said--
are you questioning me?
Where are you going?
"Come here, or I shall destroy you all."
(Grunting)
"Yo, wait up!"
Ohh!
Black here. Need transport back to hq.
And to Chinatown.
I'll have Jade spend the night at uncle's.
Jade: I heard that!
It doesn't make sense.
We were down for the count.
Why leave the spoils?
Finn: We must have left millions on that beach.
"What is the deal, big v?"
Aah!
Shendu: Valmont cannot hear you.
(Gasps)
Uh-oh. Shendu?
(Singsong) He's back.
"Your talismans, Mr. shendu."
We was taking care of 'em for ya.
"We'll just, uh, be on our way."
Keep your talismans.
They no longer matter to me.
(Groaning)
Valmont: How did I--
where is the money?
"Uh, big v, shendu's back."
What?! Where?!
Inside you.
That's preposter--
aah! Aah!
Get out!
"Shendu: Trust me, valmont,"
"the feeling is mutual,"
"but for now, you and your thugs"
will assist me
or perish.
Whoa!
Got it!
We're swinging to your beat.
Uncle: Uncle is not running a hotel!
Jade!
Help tohru make your bed.
"I'll take it from here, t."
(Doorbell rings)
Aiyaah!
We are closed!
Aah! Uhh...
Uhh...
Master?
(Groaning)
I will show you the door!
Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh!
(Groans)
"(Singsong) Oh, Jackie..."
"Jade: Valmont's inside,"
and he tossed tohru like a feather.
He must have the talismans.
Stay with uncle. Aw!
Ohh...
"Talismans, right?"
Black: Gone.
Why did he take one of uncle's books?
(Both gasp)
But I don't understand.
Valmont can't summon the shadowkhan.
Only shendu.
Shendu: Reports of my demise
"have been greatly exaggerated, chan."
Whoa. (Gasps)
Destroy them.
"Hey, Jackie"
if you could have
"any one of the talismans,"
which one would you want?
Not just one.
I think lifting-- everything.
"Yeah. I want to be fly, I want to be fast,"
I want to be invincible.
"If I really can have all the talismans,"
wow!
You can imagine
how many things I can do.
I almost can save the whole world.
"Jackie, robbery in progress."
It's the dark hand.
They're packing heat. Talisman heat.
Our spell will keep you bound
within the human of your choosing.
Until you release us.
Shendu: And the human most capable for this task...
Jackie chan.
Yi-ahh!
"Finn: Uh, big v? Shendu's back."
Destroy them!
Jackie: But I don't understand.
Valmont can't summon the shadowkhan.
Only shendu.
Reports of my demise
"have been greatly exaggerated, chan."
I'll take the guy in the ninja suit.
Better idea.
Yaah!
Ohh!
Ohh! Unh!
(Uncle chanting magic spell)
Whew!
Whoa.
"Unc, that was some magic."
Heh! Simple chi spell.
Many others in my book.
"So the big bad dragon <i> is</i> back,"
and he's packing the talismans?
Talismans are not important!
Shendu is a spirit now.
Not even the talismans can change that.
So you figure he's onto something
"bigger, <i> mi compadre?</i>"
The book shendu stole from my library
is a key to understanding his motives.
But which volume did he steal?
How do I know?!
We must take inventory!
So all these books have spells--ow!
Do not touch!
Aww.
"This is bigger than valmont, sir."
The dragon is back from the grave.
"Correct, the one with the magic talismans."
"I didn't believe it either, sir, until I--"
"uh, yes, I feel fine."
"Jackie, we can't move! The bad guys are--"
"too powerful for one archaeologist to stop, Jade."
"They'll still need you to consult, right?"
"Jackie, I just spoke with my superiors in Washington."
Are they sending reinforcements?
They're...Reassigning all dark hand matters
to section 12.
"I never should've used the ""m"" word."
But there's no time to lose.
The mainframe indicates that valmont has just left the country.
But how will you--
"my hands may be tied, Jackie,"
but yours aren't.
"But I have to go, Jade."
"Jackie, you can't face shendu alone."
You need back-up.
That's why I'm going to get uncle.
Uncle's just the brains.
You need muscle on your team.
Hmph!
And I know just where to find you some.
(Telephone rings)
<i>Buenos dias.</i>
El toro fuerte!
El toro: <i> Si?</i>
It is for you.
Jade?
"Well, what do you know?"
Uncle: We cannot leave until we know
"what shendu is planning,"
and we cannot know that
until we know which book he took.
(Door bells jingle)
Go away!
We are closed for inventory.
We are not customers.
Jackie! A burglar!
Wha--oh!
"Uncle, he is no thief!"
He is--ow!
Of course he is a thief! He is wearing a mask!
"Oh, no, no, no!"
El toro fuerte <i>never</i> removes his mask.
You!
Dark hand enemy!
Aah!
Jackie!
Ahh! Ohh! Oop!
Aah!
Whaa!
Ohh! Thank you--bwha!
"I've heard of a bull in a China shop, Jackie..."
But two?
Viper?!
No thieves allowed in uncle's--ow!
How can she be the thief?
She is not wearing a mask and wrecking my store.
Both: Aah!
Stop! Tohru is--aah!
On our side now.
Chan tells the truth.
Sorry.
Ohh.
"All right! Viper, El toro, you made it."
Who invited you?
I am El toro's protege.
"Wherever he goes, I go."
"Ok, paco. But try not to get in the way"
while Jackie's kicking butt.
But it is El toro fuerte
"who will be kicking the butt, Jade."
Jackie. El toro.
Jackie! El toro!
Jackie! El toro!
"Jade, explain."
It's your team! Duh!
The j-team! The chan clan!
The chan-tastic five!
Chan-tastic?
"5! See, - you and me make 2..."
And then there's viper...
And El toro makes 4...
"And I, paco, am the fifth member of the j-team!"
I actually had someone less...Puny in mind.
I am honored.
"I am sorry you all came here for nothing,"
but I didn't realize
my niece read so many comic books.
I cannot accept your help.
"Never pegged you as the macho type, Jackie."
I especially cannot accept help from a super-thief.
Ex-super-thief.
Went legit after the pink puma fiasco.
Uncle: Hotcha!
The missing book!
Which one is it?
A guide to ancient artifacts
located in Tibet.
"Ancient <i> magic</i> àartifacts, I bet."
Ahh!
The pan ku box.
Soon my demon brethren shall be free
and their new reign of terror will begin.
Jackie: Captain black managed to pull some strings.
He has a jet waiting.
"Ok, team, let's move out!"
"Jade, there is no team."
Oh? - These j-team jackets say you're wrong.
Ack! Ugh!
"Tohru, tend the shop and watch Jade."
The rest of you...
Get out!
"Valmont's voice: It's my body, and I say we're going home!"
Shendu's voice: You dare defy me?!
My hair!
You will suffer for--aah!
Get out of my head!
Aah! Hss!
You mortal---
"so, uh, who we rooting for?"
"Tohru: Uh, I don't know about this, Jade."
Uncle's instructions were very clear.
Uh-huh. He said to tend to the shop
"<i>and</i> watch me. Since I'm skipping town,"
you can't do both.
And seor uncle told all of us
"to get out of his shop, so we did."
(Sighs) We must stop for the night.
But what about shendu? We need to hurry--ow!
You want uncle to help
"defeat the ultimate evil, yes?"
Then uncle needs his rest!
(Gargling)
(Yawn) Lucky for us valmont got all worn out
slapping himself silly.
"Yeah, I'm bushed."
"Ratso: Good night, Finn."
"Night, ratso."
"Good night, talismans."
(Ratso snoring)
What are you doing here?
What's it look like?
Thank you. Now go away.
Go away yourself.
"I'm the super-thief, remember?"
Ex-super-thief.
Just give me! No!
Let me have-- don't!
No!
Slumbering Bear greets the Dawn!
Way to go.
Hungry wolf slaughters lamb!
(Whistles)
"Tohru, buddy!"
You're alive.
Good to see you.
Tohru's a traitor!
Then give him a taste of talisman.
Our powers! My pants!
"<i>Buenos noches,</i> à <i> muchachos!</i>"
(Snoring)
They have the talismans!
Sorry.
I trust you all had plenty of rest.
Now follow me!
Jackie! El toro!
No yelling! Uncle cannot sleep with--ohh!
Tohru?
"If you are here, who is tending my shop?"
Uh...
"Don't worry, uncle, it's covered."
Chi spells. Hmm.
Look what you did!
"Hey, it's not my fault you're not a team player."
We only wished to help.
And without us you would've been pulverized.
I was pulverized!
And the dark hand still has all the talismans!
I told you! Talismans are not important!
Of course talismans are important.
Talismans are not important!
Talismans are <i>very</i> important!
Not important! Very important!
Jackie: It's your fault we lost the talismans!
"No, it's your fault!"
The grown-ups are staring to sound like us.
And we don't have time for kid stuff.
Come on. We gotta follow shendu.
We will take them down?
Uh-uh. They're packing talismans.
But we're wily.
(All arguing)
I don't know why I'm listening to you.
I'm doing this for Jade.
Jade?
Paco?
Both: Where are the children?!
Ahh! The pan ku box!
Quickly! Take it!
"Uh, why don't you take it?"
I cannot touch it.
It is forged of good magic.
"And I, most decidedly, am not."
"Well, if nobody wants it,"
pan ku very much!
Exterminate the pests permanently!
Ohh! Ohh!
Don't worry. Jackie will rescue us.
"No, El toro will rescue us."
Jackie. El toro.
Jackie! El toro!
Jackie! El toro!
Jackie! El toro!
Ohh! Look!
Jade & paco: The j-team!
Let them go.
"Ooh, you're gonna get it now."
Yeaah!
Aah! Good magic!
Come on!
Wait here.
Grr!
Flying dragon corkscrew!
Horse tail swatting flies!
Ohh!
Inscriptions.
Invisibility <i>and</i> speed!
I'll kick your butt in fast-forward.
Gotta work on the brakes.
"Hey, Finn, can I bum a talisman?"
"Kind of busy here-- hey, hey, hey!"
Heat beams! Sweet!
"Hey, my glasses!"
Mad monkey kung fu!
Octopus fits of fury!
Shredding lion claws!
Minnows wallops whale!
"I'm sorry, what was the last part?"
I said minnow--aah!
"""What was that last part?"""
"I wasn't going to use these,"
but now you've made me mad!
Astral projection? Gaah!
Ow!
Aah!
"Jackie, we gotta get the--"
"talk later, Jade!"
Rrr!
Hey!
"I'm going out on a limb here,"
but it looks like you need contacts.
Maybe--aah!
You won't be needing this
aah! Oh! Oh! Ahh!
Oh! Oh! Aah!
"Oh, Jackie!"
Ohh!
Come on!
Give me somebody!
"Who's strong like ox now, eh, El toro?"
"Now you, skinny."
Unh! Ohh!
Yin-Yang! The power of balance!
You will be unable to knock me--oof!
"Spiritual balance, hak <i> fool.</i>"
Unh--oof!
You are blocking my light!
(All moaning)
Looking for these?
Run!
We have all 12 talismans!
Talismans are not important!
The inscriptions are.
Shendu was one of 8 demon sorcerers
"who terrorized the ancient world,"
each with his or her own magic
derived from fire...
Sky...
Moon...
Thunder...
Earth...
Mountain...
Wind...
And water.
"One by one, - the demons were defeated"
"by the 8 immortals,"
the legendary heroes of ancient China.
The immortals used powerful chi spells
to banish the demons to another realm...
Then used the pan ku box to seal them in...
Each demon behind its own portal.
The only thing which could locate
and unlock those portals
is the pan ku box itself.
So...
It is - a very good thing
that shendu did not--
shendu's gone and he took the pan ku box!
Ayah!
We must get it back
before shendu finds the doors
and releases the 7 other demons!
Jackie: I had captain black pull more strings
to provide a ride home for everyone.
Consider it my way of saying thank you
for all your help.
Weren't you listening to uncle?
The job's not finish--
shh!
But Jade is right.
Seor shendu will release the demons.
We cannot accept help from a thief.
"I am the wrestler, she is the thief."
Ex-thief.
"Don't worry, handsome."
"Next time Jackie's in a pinch,"
Jade knows who to call.
"Well, Jade, El toro may be the best..."
And Jackie may be better...
Both: But the j-team is the greatest!
Jackie! I must get back to my shop!
"Uncle, I told you,"
your shop's in good hands.
(Chanting magic spell)
(Ribbit)
"- Man: Hey, Jackie? - Yes?"
Do you watch your cartoon series?
"Of course, of course, definitely, yes."
I have to watch every episode.
It's just like my movies.
"I want to make a movie,"
"everybody understand what I'm doing,"
what I'm saying.
"I want so make sure the cartoon is me,"
and also the cartoon is good for the kids.
"Nothing wrong, just always the good things."
Yes.
Whoa.
"Not even a scratch, big v--"
"I mean, uh, shendu, sir."
Try harder.
The pan ku box must be opened.
(Kung fu yell)
Charging rhino cracks walnut!
"Uh, open sesame?"
What a absurd waste of time.
Cheerio.
Unh!
"Need I remind you, valmont..."
"That it is I who holds controlling interest in this partnership,"
and the sooner we find the portals
"and release my demon brethren,"
the sooner you will have your pathetic body to yourself.
Aah! Go! Open already!
Aah!
"Remember, I cannot touch good magic."
"Uh, shen-dude."
"Hey, it ain't no box."
It's a puzzle.
Ah. A map - to the first portal.
"Uh, it says"
"we gotta find ""that which runs, but never walks"
"to the mouth which never talks."""
A puzzle with a riddle.
Shendu: At last.
"The demon sorcerers will return and walk the earth,"
casting their shadow upon all human--
ah. Tell me - someone wrote that down.
Anyone?
"Uncle, please slow down."
You so need to chill.
"If I chill, demons will be dancing upon all our graves."
I must research the proper chi spells to seal the 7 portals.
All required ingredients must be on hand and ready.
"Uh, uh, uncle."
Hmm? At least let me help.
What do you know about magic?
I was apprentice to chi master fong for 15 years!
(Sighs) Perhaps it is time
for me to train an apprentice of my own.
Someone of sound judgment
whom I can trust with my chi knowledge.
Me--me--me!
I'll put some focus in your hocus.
Tohru.
It won't budge.
Clearly the box's way of telling us
we must find the first portal
before proceeding to the next.
"Well, if our recollection"
"of the directions are accurate,"
"the portal which imprisons po Kong, the mountain demon,"
"will be found in what is now Tokyo, Japan."
(Snores)
"Hey, t. Whatcha workin' on?"
(Snores)
"""Duplication spell for beginners."" Huh."
Uncle always says
this is his most valuable vase.
Time to double his money.
Whoa. Uncle is gonna beg me to be his apprentice.
Jackie: Uncle.
Uncle.
Pack your things.
Captain black just informed me
that shendu is headed for Tokyo.
Do not move.
What? What is it? Ow!
"Do you expect me to seal the demon door with salt and pepper, no?"
Then you go to Tokyo and find out which demon we are dealing with
so I can research a proper chi spell. Good night.
"(Sighs) Yes, uncle."
"Sounds like you could use my help, Jackie-o,"
and I've never been to Tokyo--
"Jade, - it's a school night."
Oh.
Now promise me
that you will stay here and do your homework.
Promise.
I can do my homework <i>and</i> go with Jackie.
Both: Whoa. Freaky.
Jinx! (Laughs)
Shendu: The map indicated
that we proceed 300 paces southeast
"from the cherry blossom grove,"
where we will follow that which runs but never walks
to the mouth which never talks.
Chow: I don't see any cherry blossoms.
That wretched box is thousands of years old.
There have clearly been some developments
in the landscape since then.
"Ooh. Ooh, looky- looky-looky-looky."
"No, ratso. You can't have one."
"Don't you see? It runs on batteries but doesn't walk,"
and it's got a mouth. No way it talks.
I suppose it's worth a look.
That which runs but never walks.
"I've got your back, Jack."
"Tokyo is mondo coolio, don't ya think?"
(Gasps) - What are you doing here?
Tch. Like I was gonna miss this.
But my homework-- we promised Jackie.
No. You promised Jackie.
Uncle: Aiyeeya!
(Grunts) Uncle? Ow!
You cast a lousy spell.
I did?
My one-of-a-kind vase
is no longer one-of-a-kind.
(Uncle gasps)
One more thing.
"You can tag along,"
"but no more surprises, <i> capisce?</i>"
"Both: Uh, surprise?"
Jade: Uh...
What just happened here?
Talk later. Let's roll.
Wait!
No portals to demon worlds here.
Unh!
Hey!
Jade: Jackie!
I'm open!
"Jade, what are you doing--"
why do I bother to ask?
Got it!
Get her!
I got her! (Pants)
"No, I got her!"
What do you mean? I got her...
But she don't got the box.
Ooh! Unh!
"Jade, where's the box?"
Uh... (Growls)
Gazelle pounce!
Good.
Go hide.
"Jade, please, I told you to hide."
Did not.
"Oh, bad day, bad day, bad day."
All: Unh!
(Growls) - Angry crow takes flight!
"No, no, no!"
All: Aah!
All: Aah!
All: Jackie!
I'll teach you to take things
"that don't belong to you, chan!"
I have a better idea.
Hello.
Three's a crowd.
"Jackie, are you ok?"
Oh...
I landed on the box.
Whoa.
Belly flop.
Uncle: Full line atop 2 broken lines.
"Jackie, that is a trigram of the mountain demon."
I will gather chi ingredients and come at once.
"Allow me to assist you, master."
Why? You are a lousy apprentice.
But I did not cast the duplicator spell.
"Blah. If you did not, then who did?"
Can't you guys just pull yourselves together?
"Hey, don't look at us, Copperfield."
You're the one who cast the spell.
Jackie: Jade...
Have you been contemplating the riddle?
"Sure. What riddle was that, uncle Jackie?"
(Sighs) - The riddle we must solve before shendu does.
Runs but never walks.
Mouth but never talks.
Where were you two?
Hello. Ice.
"So maybe you can, like, chill."
Quick! Hide!
Mouth but doesn't talk.
Runs but never--
"waa! Quick, Jackie. Look out the window."
Window? What are you talking-- (Gasps)
"Jackie: Jade, you are a genius."
I am?
A river runs but never walks.
Has a mouth which never talks.
The sumiya river must lead to the portal.
Waa!
"Jackie, don't worry. I can explain everything."
"(All chuckle) Hi, Jackie."
"All: Mmm. Boy, this is good."
"Uh, uh, when uncle arrives,"
tell him where to find me.
"Can't I come, Jackie?"
They're getting on my nerves.
(Chuckles) But you have so much in common.
You will have to stay here. All of you.
"All: Oh, Jackie. Do we have to?"
Valmont: When in doubt...
Allow Jackie chan to do the grunt work.
"Heave, ho!"
How do we know chan's even warm?
I don't see any portals.
"Yeah, just - a souvenir stand, and..."
"Many thanks for leading us here, chan."
"So, how are we gonna open the portal?"
Whoa.
"Behold! The triumphant return of my sister,"
"po Kong, the mountain demon."
Must be his big sister.
Enough fanfare. What's for supper?
<i>Bon appetit.</i>
"(Slurps) Mmm, an hors d'oeuvre."
"Oh, no! Unh!"
"Aah! Come back here, you!"
"(Gasps) Hurry, uncle."
Aah!
Aah! Ooh!
Unh!
Hut!
Unh! Aah!
(Roars)
(Inhales)
Aah!
Ow!
Aah!
Mmm. (Slurps)
"Jade: Hey, big Bertha."
Mmm. It's not polite to play with your food.
"Hmm, another tiny portion."
All: Tch.
All: Whoa.
(Laughs)
Whoa!
Finger food.
All: You mean knuckle sandwich.
Yaa! Po: Unh!
Waa!
Aah! Aah!
(All grunt)
"The chi spell, tohru."
(Jades roar)
Jades: Get her! Keep her pinned down
till uncle casts the chi spell!
Jades! Be careful!
(Thugs grunt)
"Unh! Nice try, girls."
Unh! Unh!
Now the drum.
"Uh, drum?"
The symbol of the immortal
who originally imprisoned po Kong.
(Gulps) I--I thought you had it.
Aiyeeeya! What kind of apprentice are you?
A lousy one.
Uncle!
(Speaking Chinese)
Jackie! Drum must be struck 3 times!
No!
Enough.
(Grunts)
All: Look out! Whoa!
Aaaah!
All: Whoa!
All: Aah!
No!
All: Unh! Oh.
Oh!
Uncle...
Jackie: The pan ku box.
I think there is a bigger problem to solve.
(Sighs) I must do research.
"Uh, no need, master."
I believe no finishing charm
was applied to the original duplication spell.
That is why it continues to repeat.
Huh?
"Uh, I did some reading during the long flight."
Tohru will be a good apprentice.
Did you bring the finishing charm?
"Mmm, but it will only work on the original Jade."
Jade!
All: Pick me! Over here!
(Grunts) I--ok.
Whoever cast the spell in the first place is grounded
with no TV for a year.
(All gasp) She did it!
Tch. Tattletales.
"-Hey, Jackie. -Yes?"
Have you ever refused to do a stunt?
"Yes. When I design a stunt,"
"I'm thinking, ""yes, I can do it."""
Suppose I go out the window
on the roof--boom!
"Land on the car with all the luggage,"
"then I slide down, then open the door,"
go to the car in one shot.
Then you can see tod--tod--chu-chu-- chu--chu!
I like to do these kind of things.
It was something I cannot do
is fly over the--the Grand Canyon.
"No, I'm not gonna do that."
"Shendu: The portal of xiao fung, the wind demon,"
"lies upon the seventh land mass,"
"4,000,001 cubits above the Southern hemisphere,"
"beyond the placid forest,"
nestled between the rolling hills.
"Uh, the only thing I see nestlin'--"
is hollow lands penitentiary.
Valmont: Do you mean to tell us that the demon portal
"lies somewhere within those prison walls, shendu?"
"Shendu: Do not take that tone with me, valmont."
I did not build the fortress.
"I've heard of bustin' <i> outta</i> jail,"
but breakin' in?
No problem. I did a stretch here.
Rumor has it there are miles of tunnels under the joint.
The pan ku box mentioned no tunnels.
And I will not waste time chasing windmills
when we can simply allow ourselves to be taken prisoner.
"Oh, no. I don't wanna go back."
Valmont and his pals have been spotted downtown.
"You in, Jackie? We're there."
Is your name Jackie?
(Scoffs)
"Captain black, I thought all dark hand matters"
had been reassigned to section 12.
"That may be so, but I'm not gonna sit pretty"
while the dark hand strolls into my backyard
to hand a hall pass to a hobgoblin.
Captain black is in the house!
(Strained groans)
"Valmont: As the head of an international crime syndicate,"
I refuse to expose myself
by robbing a common bank.
"Shendu: You seem to forget, valmont,"
"that in the event of a stalemate,"
I win.
Well?!
Must I remind you that the portal cannot be opened
"without the pan ku box, which I cannot touch?!"
Valmont: Let's get this over with.
"Capt. Black: Freeze, valmont!"
All: We surrender.
You do? You do?
Capt. Black: Take 'em away.
(Chanting Chinese incantation)
"What do you think, uncle--ow!"
Do you see any demons?
Nooo.
"That is because this is a bank vault,"
not a demon portal!
"And for your long career of federal crimes,"
I sentence you to 50 years in hollow lands
maximum-security prison.
(Finn sobbing)
"Yes, the dark hand has been successfully shut down, sir, but--"
"thank you. We are proud, sir."
But I want to recommend that valmont
be reassigned to another prison immediately.
I have reason to believe that he orchestrated
their appointment to hollow lands
in order to locate a demon portal.
"No, sir, I've never received psychological counseling. Why?"
Breathe deeply.
"Eww, are you wearing Cologne?"
Capt. Black: Aftershave.
"They didn't believe you, did they?"
(Sighs) And if we can't stop the demon
"by moving valmont out,"
we are going to have to move in.
"You don't really mean <i> we,</i> do you?"
You in? Cool! You're going undercover!
"Bu-but, I don't want to be a prison guard."
"Not a guard, Jackie, an inmate."
"Clearly, it's - of the utmost importance that valmont and his men"
"not recognize you, Jackie."
"Uh, the--the guards and warden"
will know who I really am. Right?
"Jackie, no can do."
This is completely under the radar.
Kepler: Smile.
Bwoah--ooh!
Oh!
"Don't worry,"
all you need to do
is mix your way into valmont's gang
and get ahold of that pan ku box
before they open the portal with it.
"Oh, is that all?"
Say ahhh.
Aah!
"Jackie chan, meet chance Jackson,"
master criminal.
"Prison is full of hard cases, Jackie."
Your disguise is foolproof.
"(Scoffs, snorts)"
"Hey, Jackie, you off to the big house?"
Wha--ut--grr!
"Uh, good luck, chance."
"If things get dicey, just call and say the password,"
chinchilla.
"Uh, what's a chinchilla?"
"Oh, captain black,"
your supervisors have requested
"that we speak with you, <i> ja?</i>"
"Valmont: We can't find the portal until the pan ku box arrives,"
so we will just have to wait.
"Well, we could've been traipsing our way out through those tunnels"
with our demon of the week by now.
<i>Alleged</i> tunnels.
"Anything's better than doin' time, right, ratso?"
"Come on, let's - toss a few before lunch."
(Eagerly) They're serving gruel again.
What? It's fun-food.
Bingo.
(Gruffly) Bingo!
"Unh. Ooh, sorry."
"(American accent) Er, sorry I didn't rearrange your molecules!"
Watch where you're goin' next time.
"So, uh, what are you in for?"
Go away.
"Chance Jackson, safecracker."
Big whoop!
I crack them with my head.
Hmm. You like baseball?
"Ho ho, do I!"
"Aww, you guys oughta give chance a chance."
He's one of us.
Probably why he reminds me of somebody.
"Howdy, guys. Chance!"
You wrangled kitchen duty.
Supplies! Everyone back!
At ease.
"A bit obvious, but--"
what?!
"Hey, that's the warden's birthday cake!"
You just won a free trip to solitary.
"Shendu, mentally: Valmont, you are an imbecile!"
Uh-oh.
"Well, it's gotta be somewhere."
P.A.: All inmates report to mess hall for lunch.
You're in safe hands now.
(Gasps)
No!
Goo--oh--aargh!
"(Roaring, growling)"
H-hello.
I am free!
Whoa. We struck demon.
"Not any demon. Xiao fung, demon of the wind."
"Uh, like breakin' wind?"
(Cries out)
Ooh-oh!
Like breaking bones.
"You care to explain the swipe-and-run, chance?"
Easy on him. He found our boy.
Yeah!
"Good instincts, buddy."
"So, uh, what's with tumble dry?"
"Ahh, the sweet scent of freedom."
"Uh, actually, your breeziness, sir,"
you're not exactly free.
No?
You're in the hoosegow. Prison.
This prison is paradise
compared to the ghastly abyss I have escaped.
"Whatever you say, chief,"
but outside's even better.
"Beaches, movies..."
"Yeah, so why don't you huff and puff"
and blow this big house down?
No! I--I mean...
"You can't leave without your boss, can you?"
Where is shendu?
"Uh, shendu's in valmont..."
And valmont's in solitary.
"Hmm. If I do not free this valmont,"
I will be burdened
with freeing - my brothers and sisters.
Very well.
"Whoa, you guys can do that?"
Concealment seems prudent.
Demons appear to stick out like sore thumbs
in this modern world.
"Ooh, he's gonna blend in undercover-like."
"Get it, chance?"
"Uh, got it."
"Uh, chinchilla."
What's a chinchilla? That's the password.
Just get me captain black.
"What do you mean, he can't be disturbed?"
Demon.
I see a demon.
And this one?
Socks worn by a really big demon.
"(American accent) Uncle, it's, uh, me, your nephew."
What? It does not sound like you.
What do you mean you are in prison?
You are a bad influence on Jade.
Good thing it is not really you.
"Who was that, uncle?"
"Eh, crank call."
Prince Albert in a can?
"No, crazy talk about demons and prisons."
(Gasps) Ai-yaah!
We're gonna create a diversion
so we can sneak into solitary.
What's the plan?
Both: Food fight!
(All yell)
Ratso: Psst. Chance.
Let's break for it.
"(American accent) So, we goin' or what?"
I liked you.
(Normal voice) Uh-oh.
"Hey, xiao, meet Jackie chan."
Nemesis to my brethren?
Ooh!
What just happened here?
Never mind. Solitary.
Aah! Unh!
"Jade: Hi, Jackie."
Jade? Uncle?
How?
"Tohru: Invisibility, levitation, speed."
I borrowed some talismans
so we could bust you out of the slammer.
"Oh! Well, I don't want to be out."
I want to be in where the wind demon is.
Hmm. The fan is the symbol
belonging to the immortal
who originally banished the wind demon.
I must gather chi spell ingredients.
But there's no time.
Duh.
Ooh! Yaah!
Whoa-oh!
"Unh, oh."
"Oh, some set of pipes."
"The, uh, valmont suite."
"Ah, greetings, brother xiao."
See? I knew there were tunnels.
But I just broke out!
I demand to be thrown into solitary.
I don't recognize him.
What's your prisoner number?
Ohh!
Jade.
Jade.
(Alarm blares) The dragon talisman
is very dangerous.
Talk later. Chinchilla.
"So, that's a chinchilla. Cute."
Change him back.
Fire in the hole.
"Jade, stay here."
"Tch, in a prison?"
Well--ohh.
The way out's gotta be that way.
"Nah, we just came from there."
"Shendu, I have had enough"
of your lost expedition!
"Valmont: Shendu, your brother is speaking to you."
"Do not follow so closely, Jade,"
and pay attention to everything I do.
Waah!
So good to see you again.
In fact...
I'm all a-bluster.
(Inhales)
"Back off, froggy!"
Both: Aah!
Both: Waah!
Both: Unh!
(Xiao roars) Both: Aah!
(Inhales)
(Grunts)
"(Grunts, gasps)"
Where is uncle?!
Uncle: I am sorry.
I will bring this back. Thank you.
Put a cork in it!
(Exhales)
Aah! Chinchil-- aah!
(Gasps) Uh-oh.
Uncle: Ai-yaaah!
We will never find them.
Both: Whoa!
Unh. Ai-yaah.
"Uncle, quickly!"
"Ah, Jackie. There you are."
Where is he?
(Gasps)
You are going to be sorry!
"Xiao fung, the chi spell will seal your doom!"
One cannot cast what one cannot catch.
(Inhales)
Wait! Let us get out of the way!
(Exhales)
<i>Sensei!</i>
Ai-yaah!
The talisman!
"Rabbit talisman is very good,"
but demon breath is better.
Tohru! Human wind shield!
(Uncle grunts)
(Grunts)
Shendu: The old man! Stop him!
Aah!
(Grunts)
Both: Unh!
Both: Whoa! Oh!
Heeya! Both: Oh!
Both: Unh!
(Incants in Chinese)
<i>Sensei.</i>
Uh-uh-uh.
Hi-yah!
Unh! Unh!
All: Aah!
All: Ooh!
(All cough)
"Check it out, big v."
Jackie!
Fan the fan!
It's working!
Nooo!
Looks like it's off
to the wind in the willows
for Mr. toad.
"Now, before we head home,"
we must retrieve the talismans.
"Ooh, right."
Huh?
What do you know?
His prisoner number checks out.
"You're gettin' your wish, Jackson."
It's solitary for you.
"Uh, what? No!"
I-I'm not chance Jackson!
Look at my face! My face!
Chinchilla! Chinchilla!
"Hey, Jackie,"
"if you could be an animal,"
which animal would you be?
I wanna be a eagle.
"I remember, uh, I have a--a eagle about this big."
"Way up to look down. Ok, nobody can chase you."
"Very free, you know, wherever I wanna go."
"I think eagle. Yes, that's the best animal I would be."
Hyah!
Aah!
(Exhales)
"Not bad, Mickey,"
but your form needs work.
"Spar with, uh, someone else"
while I confer with captain black.
"Sorry about the hard knocks, my friend,"
"but since section 13's officially out of the dark hand business,"
I had to devise a way to justify your overhead to my superiors.
"Did you put me on the books as personal trainer,"
or punching bag?
Jade: Hyah-ha!
(Gasps)
Jade!
What?
"Oh, I, uh, told Mickey to work on that form."
"Shendu: Ah, ah..."
Gingerly.
Watch your step.
Place it over to the left...
Valmont: And into the incinerator.
We could use some firewood.
Shendu: Silence!
"With some sprucing, this fish heap"
will be worthy of housing a demon sorcerer--
valmont: Ex-demon sorcerer.
"Shendu: - I may be vanquished,"
"but I am still in charge, valmont,"
as you can well see.
"Valmont: - This is my hideout, and my body, shendu."
"Which reminds me,"
I have a change of wardrobe in mind for us.
(Gasps)
You wouldn't dare.
Aah! Aah!
That is a thousand-year-old heirloom
from the ling dynasty!
"Well, maybe if game geek over there would have helped."
Oh...
Chow.
"Shendu: Ah, yes."
"Directions to the door which contains tchangzu,"
the thunder demon.
"Hey, Cali-for-ni-yay."
We are here--
"and we are to go south,"
to--
"you got that, didn't you?"
Uh...
"Pretty much all of it,"
"before we, uh, ran out of tape."
(Growls)
"Dude, run."
(Shendu growls)
Aah!
(Gasps)
Water!
"That's right, big v--"
swimmin' pools <i>and</i> movie stars.
We're headin' for...
Jackie: Hollywood?
"I'm on my way, captain black."
"Jackie, can I come with, please?"
"Jade, the dark hand is there,"
no doubt searching for a demon portal.
But rafaello dicapezio is getting his footprints in cement
at the Chinese theater this weekend.
Who-faello di-who-zio?
Hello?
Rafaello dicapezio is only
the greatest movie star in the history of...
History.
Uncle: Ahh...
I guess you have never heard of John Wayne.
"Ahh, the Duke."
"(Imitating John Wayne) Saddle up, pilgrim."
"Hmm, I suppose this is one time"
you could come along and not be in the way.
Yes!
"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
"Jackie: Tohru will be your chaperone,"
while I search for the dark hand.
"Well, the festivities aren't till tonight,"
so why don't we just take a minute
and help you find the demon door?
Happy sightseeing.
"I am so sorry that I screamed, Jade."
"Yeah, uh,"
"Frankenstein did look pretty lifelike, t."
Must be all that wax.
"Uh, maybe we should bring back a souvenir for uncle."
Do you have any photos of John Wayne?
Tohru.
"Aw, we're wanderin', anyway."
I want to see Clark gable's old house.
"Frankly, ratso, I don't give a darn."
And who's wanderin'?
We got directions right here.
"Chow: Yeah. Halfway between ""the pools of despair"""
"and ""the trail of treachery."""
It's all so clear.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Jackie, the dark hand guys"
are right outside the wax museum.
"Uh, Jade, how do you do that?"
Never mind.
Do nothing until I get there.
Can't hear you.
(Imitating static)
You're breaking...
Up.
Jade? Oh!
The wax museum--quickly!
Which do you think uncle would like best?
Jade?
"Jade: Look, the 3 stooges!"
Where? Duh.
All: Hey!
Heh.
"You must want this, huh?"
"Say ""cheese,"" Princess."
"""Cheese, Princess."""
Tohru!
Maybe he'd like to see some real stars.
Finn: Chan!
Does this qualify as being outnumbered?
Works for me.
"Jade, are you all right?"
"Peachy. Jackie, I got--"
"what part of ""do nothing"" didn't you understand?"
"But Jackie, I got-- watch her."
(Moans)
(Gasps)
I have waited for this moment.
Prepare to meet your doom.
I didn't know the dark hand had a new enforcer.
Hyah!
(Grunting)
Aah!
(Both grunting)
Wires?
Nigel: Cut!
Who are you?
This is a movie set?
Awesome. Are you gonna put Jackie in your movie?
"Oh, sure, after I have him arrested!"
"Nigel, Nigel, calm down."
"Larry Franklin, producer of <i> ninjas in the hood.</i>"
That was quite a display the way you--
"""bam"" and ""bam, bam!"""
(Laughs)
- You have an agent? - Uh...
That would be <i> moi.</i>
"Bam, bam. This town's gettin' younger every day."
"Look, lar,"
"Jackie chan here is going to be the next big action superstar,"
and you have the opportunity
to get in on the ground floor.
Jade.
"Right, Jackie. Did I mention that he does all his own stunts?"
Oh!
"Give me a jingle. If jc can act, bam--"
we're in business.
(Scoffs) Act? Jack--whoa!
"Say bye-bye to the nice man, Jade."
"Jackie, play your cards right, and you can be a star."
I don't want to be a star.
I want to find the demon portal
before valmont's men do.
"Oh, that. It's in the bag."
"Jade, how do you do that?"
"Jackie: If ""the pools of despair"" are the tar pits..."
"And ""the trail of treachery"" is the cahuenga pass..."
Halfway should be right here.
"""Megagalactic studios?"""
"Boy, talk about your co-ink-I-dink."
"As long as we're gonna be on the lot,"
"why don't we ""do lunch"" with lar?"
"Because ""we"" had a big breakfast."
Pass?
Uh...
"Hey, you're talkin' to the star"
of <i> beach babewatch</i> here.
"Oh, uh, sorry."
Go right ahead.
Oh! The dark hand?
Pass?
"Yes, I would like to."
"No, can't let you on the lot"
without a pass.
(Ring)
Good afternoon.
Jade arts talent agency.
"Jade, I--"
I can't get onto the studio lot.
"Yes, but--"
"yes, b-but--"
"ok, I'll do it."
(Telephone rings) Jade? Hello?
Megagalactic studios.
"Hey, sipowicz."
See the human action figure
with the million-dollar smile outside your gate?
"He's Jackie chan, the next big thing,"
and he has a meeting with <i> the</i> Larry Franklin.
So let me give you lar's number
so you can explain how we're about to sign a deal
"with another studio, because you wouldn't let"
the man who does his own stunts onto the lot.
"Uh, your pass?"
"Uh, sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. chan."
How does she do that?
You gettin' anything?
It's got to be somewhere around here.
Sorry I can't bring it back! Thank you!
Chan!
Get him!
(Buzz)
Yes?
"Oh, put her through."
"Jade, what's up?"
"Lunch? Well, let me check my--"
whoa!
What goes up.
Woodchuck Chucks wood!
Whoa...
Aah!
Bam! He really does do his own stunts.
"Uh, of course he does."
"So, Larry baby, we're on for tomorrow?"
You bet--heh--
unless your client's in traction.
Jackie has a meeting.
"I'm da bomb. Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"Um, we're going to be late for the footprint ceremony."
"Rafaello, right!"
Oh...
"Ah, oh."
How come everyone can do that?
Ah! Oh!
Huh? Wha--
the portal!
"Greetings, tchangzu."
What took you so long?
Just the usual interference
from Jackie chan.
Then he will interfere no longer.
(Roars)
"As the thunder claps,"
"so do I applaud your skill, brother."
"Shendu, you may call me ""master."""
Of course...
Master.
"Ooh, sss..."
"Now, take me to my palace."
"Oh, rubber is an excellent insulator."
"The surroundings may not seem familiar,"
but I assure you--
my palace!
These humans have paved my paradise
and constructed a--
parking lot.
(Roar)
I will rebuild my palace.
"For the time being, shendu,"
you shall find a dwelling place which befits me.
"Uh, how 'bout that one?"
Hmm...
That will do.
Isn't he the dreamiest?
He's all right.
(Crowd murmuring)
Uh-oh.
"Away, infidels!"
(All murmuring)
Why do they not flee?
They think you are...
Entertainment.
Hmm...
Jade: Who's in charge here?
We specifically asked that crowds be kept
at least 60 feet away.
"What are you talkin' about, miss?"
How are we supposed to film with all this interference?
Do you know how much that animatronic suit cost?
Film?
They told us it was a footprint ceremony.
Let's go. Crowd control.
"Wow, these agents are gettin' younger every day."
Uncle: The immortal who cast the original chi spell
"on tchangzu, the thunder demon"
was patron deity of actors.
And the portal was located in a movie studio?
Weird. (Cell phone rings)
Hello?
Where are you?
Duh. Chinese theater?
"But so's the thunder demon,"
and he's packin' serious boltage.
How do you do--
"oh, Jade, do nothing until I get there."
Jade never does nothing.
"I know, but I feel I have to say it."
"Jade: So raf, here's all you gotta do."
When Jackie chan comes running in--
Jackie who?
(Sighs)
Will you sign my arm?
I'm callin' my manager.
He's not so dreamy anymore.
"Relax, t. Raf'll come crawling back"
once he reads about this in tomorrow's papers.
Lar? Jade.
"If you want to catch Jackie in action,"
come to the Chinese theater pronto.
Where is the demon?
Inside.
"Uncle, the chi spell's ready?"
I cannot prepare the spell.
What?! Need ingredients.
Why don't you have ingredients?
How am I supposed to gather chi ingredients
when you steal my apprentice?
"""Chaperone."" Pahh."
Oh.
Chinatown. Hurry.
I'll try to keep tchangzu inside.
Jackie! What?
"Please, Jade, stay here."
Uncle: One more thing.
Powder of komodo dragon tooth.
One more thing.
Tincture of tortoise shell.
One more thing.
"Castanets, the symbol of tsao kuo-ch'iu."
(Crash)
In Chinatown?
Tchangzu: I will scorch this city to the ground
while the sound of thunder resonates!
Heh. Guy's a regular Olivier.
"Welcome to the cheap seats, chan."
You!
I shall prove that lightning can indeed strike twice.
Baah!
Aah!
Oh...
If life gives you lemons...
"Lar, glad you could make it."
Show's about to start.
What show?
Aah!
Bam!
Rhymes with chan.
State of the art.
You guys go all out.
Jade: Uncle!
Must prepare chi spell.
Hold these.
Who's the old guy?
Cranky co-star-- occasional comedy relief.
Forget chan!
"If that accursed old man completes his chi spell,"
you will be cast back into limbo.
That would be our cue.
(Tohru grunts)
(Roars)
Aah!
(Gasps)
"Uh, bam?"
Oh!
"Jade, play castanets, now!"
He's also our musical director.
(Uncle chanting)
(Grunts)
No!
Ole!
(Growls)
"So, uh, lar, I'm thinking buddy picture?"
"Chan and dicapezio, dicapezio and chan."
"There is no picture,"
and Jackie chan will never do lunch in this town again
ever!
Lar didn't say anything about dinner.
"Come on, my treat."
We know of - a Mexican restaurant
where uncle found the castanets.
In Chinatown?
Hollywood is a strange and mysterious place.
So we didn't get a movie deal.
Jackie chan has definitely made his mark in Hollywood.
"Hey, Jackie,"
have you ever met anybody famous?
"One year I was doing, uh, Oscar."
I was standing in the green room.
There's so many big stars in the green room.
"I see--wow, John Travolta."
Tom Hanks.
"Oh, my god-- Sidney poitier."
I don't know what-- what should I say?
"Suddenly, - there's a voice--"
"""Jackie chan, can I shake your hand?"
I turn around-- Robin Williams.
"He said, ""Jackie, I'm a big fan of yours."
"You are great."" That makes me proud."
Ahh. Finally.
Uncle said this book could help put an end
"to all of this ""demon portal"" business."
I hope uncle is right.
Aah! Oh!
Uhh...Uhh...Oh!
Shadowkhan!
Uhh!
"Let go! Leggo, leggo!"
Chan at 12 o'clock.
Grab the ladder. - We're showing chan the door.
"Enforcers: Heave, ho!"
Aaah!
Whew. I guess it's curtains for me.
Uh... Oopsy?
Heh heh. Ha.
"Boy: Oh, wow!"
Girl: Drew got a tattoo?!
"Yeah, been thinkin' I might get one of those."
"Oh, yeah, sure, Jade."
Like your dig-in-the-dirt- with-tiny-brushes
uncle Jackie would ever let you get a tattoo.
"He would so let me, drew!"
"By tomorrow, I'm gonna have the gnarliest tattoo"
in the history of...Gnarl!
Uncle: <i> The archive</i> à <i> of demon magic</i>
"is an encyclopedia of spells,"
written by the demon sorcerers themselves.
But it may hold clues which will help defeat
the demons who created it.
"Both of you, clear room for my new research project."
"Both: Yes, uncle."
(Humming)
"Hey, Jackie, how was your trip?"
Have you lost weight? Can I get a tattoo?
"Ha, my trip was--"
a tattoo?!
"Please, Jackie?"
All the kids at school are--
no. But--
no. But--
no. But--
no tattoos for Jade. Period.
Aw!
(Sighs) Drew was right.
What am I gonna--
Jade: Whoa.
My tattoo doesn't have to be real.
It just has to be gnarly.
A little ink...
A little water...
A little squeeze...
And I'm bad to the bone.
"I will put up with a lot, shendu,"
but I draw the line at wearing a dress!
Shendu: This is a sorcerer's robe!
Finn: Whoa!
Shendu-dette.
Pretty dress.
Very becoming.
Grr! Where is my archive?!
"Uh, chan's got it?"
But it wasn't our fault!
"Yeah, that's right. The shadowkhan were there, too."
The shadowkhan are my puppets.
They do only what I command.
Are you suggesting this is my fault?
Uh-uh.
Then redeem yourselves.
No doubt - chan has brought my book
to his uncle's shop.
"Oh, but every time we go there,"
we get our butts kicked.
You have never been there...
With me.
Boy: Wow.
Girl: It's even gnarlier than drew's tattoo.
And I didn't scream once while they were doing it.
(Scoffs) That looks about as real
as those magic ninjas Jade's always talking about.
"The ninjas are real,"
and so's my tattoo!
Unlike yours.
"Hey, where's your tattoo?"
"Uh...Well, I thought you knew."
They peel right off.
Like this!
"Hey, watch it, drew! Cut it out!"
Whoa!
Uh...
Told you it was real.
"Come on, off!"
Off!
I'm in trouble.
Hey.
Jade...
Why are you wearing snow boots?
Heard it might snow?
It's 72 degrees out.
Avalanche!
Heh. False alarm.
"Oh! Jade, wash this off right now!"
"Er, tried that."
What? It's a real tattoo?
By accident!
How can you get a tattoo by acci--ohh!
(Uncle gasps)
This is a symbol of great evil.
We must find a spell to remove it immediately.
Who knows what catastrophe such a tattoo will bring?
Hand over the--
yaaaah!
Angry crow takes flight!
Yah! Uhh!
Mad monkey kung fu!
Mantis boxing style!
Rabbit punch!
Swish!
I got it!
Aah!
Lion stalks its prey!
"Run like cheetah, leap like gazelle!"
Uhh...Uhh!
Uh-oh.
Yaaaah!
Black tiger corners little lamb.
Help!
Anybody!
(Gasps) Shadowkhan.
"Oh, no, oh, no oh, no, oh, no."
Bunny flees from vicious jackals.
Aaaah!
I'm...Still alive?
Weird.
I am telling you
it was the shadowkhan who did this to me!
"Finn: Chan kicked our butts, too."
"Yeah, you don't hear us lying about it."
"Need I remind you,"
the shadowkhan do only what I command.
"Come, minions!"
Minions?
"Valmont: It would seem you have lost your touch, shendu."
Shendu: I have not lost my touch!
Chan is obviously using the power
of my archive against me!
"I don't care how you do it,"
but get my book!
Jackie: Jade?
Jade?!
"Wake up, you're going to be late."
I am going to uncle's
"to help him find a tattoo-removing spell,"
so I will see you there after school.
(Yawns) Mmm.
"Jackie: Oh, and don't forget to eat breakfast."
(Scoffs) I wish I had time for breakfast.
Aah!
Breakfast?
The tattoo.
That's what happened last night!
I called for help and you guys came!
Jade: <i> Tres chique.</i>
Mmm.
Now this has to be our little secret.
"If Jackie won't let me have a tattoo,"
there's no way he'd let me have my own ninjas.
"Oh, forgot my wallet. Are you ready for--"
under control.
Why are you wearing black?
I'm in a dark mood.
"Jade: Get ready, guys."
Time to prove my magic ninjas are for real.
"Ha ha! Oh, yeah?"
"Being dumb enough to get a real tattoo is one thing,"
but ninjas? Come on!
Ha ha ha!
(Kids laugh)
Let me show you.
"Heh heh. Later, ninja girl."
Ohh.
Finn to ratso: I'm in position.
Uncle: Too busy! Come back later!
But I am a wealthy art collector.
Welcome to uncle's rare finds.
Were you looking for something in particular?
"Oh, just some priceless artifacts"
"for the many, many museums I own."
Jackie! Tohru!
Uncle: Bring tea!
Uncle: This one dates back to the han dynasty.
It is a very good piece.
"Uh, I'll let you know."
You are both very bad salesmen!
Having ninja tutors is gonna make homework
way more fun!
Can you believe they bought my disguise?
Ho ho ho! What a plan.
We're geniuses!
They're here.
Give 'em a spanking.
You were too slow with the tea.
Good salesmen must always--
wha--wha--wha--
where is the archive?!
Uhh!
Jade! Jade!
It's ok. He's one of us.
"Jade: See, Jackie? Total control."
"They do what I tell 'em,"
and I only tell 'em to do good.
So can I keep 'em?
"Jackie: No, Jade."
"Aw, why not?"
Because - you're turning blue.
Blue's my favorite color.
"Besides, we gave tohru a chance."
Tohru is human.
Now I want you to make them go away
until uncle can find a--
hot chaaaa!
I have found a potion
that will make Jade's tattoo vanish.
But I like my tattoo. You can't do this to me.
"Jackie: It's for your own safety, Jade."
Now sit still while I apply the potion.
Ohh!
Jade: Do not touch me!
I am and shall remain
queen of the shadowkhan.
Jade!
I...Uh...
You're grounded!
(Scoffs) You're not giving me orders anymore.
I must find her.
I will take the potion.
Run a background check and--whoa!
"Jade, you-- what happened to you?"
I've become queen...
(Gasps)
And every queen needs a palace.
Jade!
Jaaade!
Jade? Black.
Jade's gone ninja.
And they've taken section 13.
Jade: Fo...Shee...Kwong...
Shoo...Wee--
grr! How can I know the secrets of the archive
if I can't understand
"a single, stupid word of it?!"
Bring me someone who can.
Shendu: So are you telling me
"I still don't have my book back,"
and the child controls my minions?!
Valmont: What? Aah! Help!
Shendu: No.
This could work to my advantage.
Valmont: (Gasps) We're in section 13.
The talismans!
"Shendu: Quiet, you fool!"
Take the talismans if you desire them.
I am interested in far greater powers.
Valmont: Smashing! I'll just--uhh!
"Shendu: I require no talismans, your majesty."
I only wish to pay my respects.
Ow!
Uh...Uh...
(Gasps)
"Jade: Now read me a story, demon."
"Forgive me, your highness."
"I could easily translate this entire volume for you,"
but true power does not reside in textbooks.
"I could teach you, dark queen."
And why should I trust you?
Beware!
Oh! Uhh! I--oh!
You!
Do you trust me now?
Take the potion from him!
Ooh...
Gaaa!
Oh!
Haa...Uhh...
Ooof!
"Your skill far exceeds your years, majesty."
Uhh!
Oh. Bwooo!
(Gasps)
No!
"Hear this, my queen:"
Your first and most valuable lesson:
Always destroy your enemies.
"Don't listen to him, Jade."
"He's a demon. I'm your uncle,"
your friend!
(Scoffs) You were.
But things are different now.
I have new friends.
"Oh? If shendu is your friend,"
why is he stealing your book?
Hiss! Traitor!
After him!
Nooo!
No!
Destroy chan!
"No, destroy..."
The book!
Nooo!
Ohh!
Hyaaaaah!
Uhh!
Ooof!
Valmont: You could've at least let me grab
"the talismans, shendu."
Very important rule of magic.
Always make extra. Just in case.
Ohh...I have a weird feeling
I did something bad.
If you mean getting a tattoo
"when I told you not to,"
"yes, you did."
But if you mean destroying
the demon archive...
We can live with that.
"Hey, Jackie, what kinds of books do you like to read?"
"I like mystery, comedy, everything."
All can helping me for the location scout.
"Different pictures, wow."
I like good magazines and education magazines.
I can really learn a lot of things.
It really helps me.
Yes!
Yes.
"To find this portal,"
we must travel north... Very north.
"Brrr, chilly."
"Very, very north."
"Ok, check the warranty on the box."
We're like halfway to the moon.
Where did you think
tso LAN the moon demon would be found?
(Nervous chuckle) No way to get up there.
"Ha! Yeah, right."
It's not like valmont owns a flying saucer.
"Yeah, I mean, we'd have to go all the way to cape"
whatchacall in Florida to catch a rocket to space--oof!
"Ahh, - very well, then."
Why couldn't it have been the earth demon?
Jade.
Maybe a working volcano exhibit
is too advanced for me.
Jackie?
Science project.
"Valmont and his cronies have been spotted in Florida,"
near cape canaveral.
I'm on my way.
"Goin' on a mission, Jackie?!"
"Uh, no. Not a mission. It's..."
A conference on feng shui.
In Minnesota.
Want to come?
"Um, I would Jackie, but, you know"
I have that new science project to cook up.
My goosebumps are gettin' goosebumps.
I say we vote.
"Anyone who doesn't want to go orbital,"
raise your hand.
"Uh, we didn't count valmont's vote."
Never mind valmont.
You will board that spacecraft or you will perish.
Unh.
No sign of the portal.
Let's keep it that way.
Rocks and minerals... Dullsville.
Photosynthesis... Double dullsville.
(Sighs) Maybe I can get inspired by the science network.
Announcer: The launchpad area has been cleared for liftoff
"of the experimental space shuttle, <i> saratoga,</i>"
which will later dock with space station <i>niagara.</i>
Hello.
"Minnesota, hmm?"
Announcer: Liftoff in t-minus 30 seconds.
"Oh, uh, don't we need like, astronaut training?"
Climb aboard!
"Announcer: Countdown at 10, 9..."
"8, 7, 6..."
"5, 4..."
"3, 2..."
1...
Liftoff. We have liftoff.
Aah!
Black.
Tell uncle I have a strong hunch
that the portal belongs to the moon demon.
(Machines hiss) (Gasp)
(Gasp) Talk later!
Ah!
Whoa.
"Ahh, liftoff, indeed."
Where are we?
What are you wearing?
"Oh, no! Oh, no!"
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no!"
"Uh, we're cruisin' for la Luna, big v."
But that's impossible!
Who's piloting this craft?
Ahoy.
There has been a grave error.
"I demand you turn this ship around, posthaste!"
Aah!
(Screaming)
Aw.
"Aah! Guh, guh..."
"Hi, Jackie."
Jade!
Check out the monkey suit.
Literally.
"But, how did you--"
speed talisman. Fastest way to get to...
Minnesota.
Autopilot.
"You can relax, big v."
Major Matt monkey's flying with training wheels.
I feel so much better.
"Ugh, those whirly rides make me nauseous."
Space makes me nauseous.
The spinning of the station creates gravitational pull. See?
"I am so going to get an ""a"" on my science project."
Secure the station.
Piece of cake. We're the only ones here.
Let us ensure utmost privacy.
Surveillance and communications systems
are down? How?
The monkey.
"Now, we wait for this station to intersect"
with the portal belonging to tso LAN.
And open her up with this key.
I hope uncle is on his way with that chi spell.
This is a level 7 override.
My engineers will take over from here.
Ok.
I have a second shuttle prepped to take you to Jackie.
Aiiyah! Do I look like flash Gordon?
I am too old to play space man!
"But, if you do not go, sensei, who will cast the chi spell?"
(Groans)
We are mere minutes from the portal location.
Ready the pan ku box.
Uhh!
Well?!
"Yo, chow"
oh!
Whoa.
Chan!
Everybody's an astronaut.
Where is the pan ku box?!
(Hissing)
(Snarls) Hak foo!
Retrieve it! Unh!
"You go, hak!"
"And you, simpletons,"
get chan!
Jackie!
You use it!
Raaah!
Uhh! Uhh!
The <i> eagle</i> has landed.
Tiger prowls...
Through pudding.
Turtle fist!
Sloth kick!
Aah!
Uhh! (Gasp)
"Oh, boy."
(Chuckling)
Flying monkey snatches magic box.
Yaah!
Uhh!
Where is hak foo?!
The portal approaches.
"No box, no demon. Check, please!"
(Chattering)
Good monkey.
Nice monkey.
"No, cosmo! Run!"
Give it up! Give it up!
(Cosmo screeches)
Huh?
Yes.
"Houston, we have a problem."
Get it.
"Tso LAN, so good to see you."
"Skip the pleasantries, shendu."
I am interested only in seizing control of the moon's gravity
so that I may pull the ball from its orbit.
But--but that'll wreck all of earth's ecosystems.
How do <i> you</i> know?
<i>I</i> watch the science network.
Puhhht!
The child is correct.
And only then will earth's landscape be to my liking.
Whoa! He wants to kebosh the planet.
And you made us let him out?
Just be glad you are up here.
Duh-oh!
Argh! Ehh...
You have joined us in time to see the Nemesis of all demon sorcerers destroyed.
This is Jackie chan?
No. That is.
Bwwaaaa!
Ah! Oh! Uhh!
Duh-ah!
Time to put out the trash.
Uhh!
"Shendu, I despise you."
I heard that.
It appears the pleasure of destroying you shall be mine alone.
A good chi spell would be nice right now.
"Tohru, can you hear me?"
Wha-a-a-at?
You make faces at me!
Whu...Uh...Eh--
"no, sensei."
Hiding only delays the inevitable.
Hey...
Lucky rabbit.
(Chittering)
Shoo! Shoo!
(Chittering)
(Screeching)
I see no one.
"Uncle: Prepare the chi spell, <i>then</i> socialize!"
"Now, do you have the lotus pod?"
Check.
Jelly of jelly fish?
Check.
(Screeching)
Behold...
My mastery of gravity.
"And for you, things look very grave."
"Jackie, man the torpedo."
Full speed ahead!
Uhh!
Outta the park.
Uh-oh.
He's rolling down moon river.
This is very bad. We need uncle's chi spell.
Earth to Jackie. We're in <i> space.</i>
Where are we gonna get a chi spell?
A lotus pod?
Isn't that...?
The symbol of the immortal
who originally defeated tso LAN the moon demon.
- Tohru? - Tohru!
But...Where's uncle?
"Uncle, yelling: Tohru!"
Do you or do you not have nosehair of possum?!
Hmm...
Could use a facelift.
"Tall, dark, and creepy's doing his moon-makeover thing."
"Tohru, the chi spell."
Uncle: A spell can not work
if a demon is out of range of the immortal's symbol!
How can we move the immortal symbol into range fast?
Jade: Duh!
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
"Jade, it's not safe."
So?
"Eh, it's never safe."
I require assistance.
"Awww, I thought that's why you brought cosmo."
Where on earth do I find a moon demon on the moon?
Oh!
Behind you.
Heh. Hello.
You dare interrupt me in my moment of triumph?
It's what I do.
Whuh!
Oh!
Oh...
Where's the lotus pod?
You put it in your suit.
Found it.
"Tohru, the incantation!"
Uncle: Aiyaaa! That is my job!
Uncle!
Hurry!
(Chanting)
(Uncle chanting)
An incantation?
(Chanting continues)
The lotus pod.
"In order for it to hex me,"
"you must remove your helmet,"
which you cannot do.
Oh! Grrr! Eh!
Then let me air this out.
(Inhales)
Aah!
Ah! (Breaths deeply)
Yesss!
(Cheering)
Right on!
"So long, tso LAN."
My science product is gonna rock!
"Hey, Jackie, if you weren't an actor,"
what would you be?
I wanna be a pilot.
"Oh, I just feel so cool."
Nothing cooler than pilot.
(Imitates plane flying)
"Carrying the helmet, wearing the suit,"
walking... But slow-motion.
The track behind you--
with--with the glasses.
"Just by yourself, go to the place nobody knows, you know."
"Oh, just, I wanna be a pilot."
(Coughs)
Oh...The armor of the 8 immortals.
"Hmm, doesn't seem very special."
Ehh...Heh. Housekeeping?
Heh. Termites.
Daah!
Unh. Ohh.
Aaaahhhh!
Whoa!
"Uh, pass the bok choy, please?"
Jackie! Aah!
You are too loud!
"Uncle, you are the one who's yelling."
(Gasps)
You dishonor the only known existing relic
of the 8 immortals.
You caused me to drop it.
(Gasps) You dishonor your uncle.
"Hey, Jackie."
"Jade, what are you doing up?"
"""Old yeller"" is keeping us all up."
He hasn't slept in days.
"Tohru, where is my tea?"
(Snores) What?
(Continues snoring)
Aiyaaa!
"Uncle, why won't you sleep?"
Because I have demons on the brain.
"I lay down, and all I hear is..."
"Chi spell, chi spell, chi spell."
Have you tried counting sheep?
Demons always eat them.
"Ah, well, thank you for watching Jade."
Where are you going?
We must study the immortals' armor
and discover what magic it holds.
"Now? It is 3 A.M., uncle."
You should really try to sleep.
(Cell phone rings)
How can I sleep with all this noise?
Yes?
"Jackie, we've spotted the dark hand."
I'm on my way.
Care to know where you're going?
I don't care. Anywhere but here.
Ok.
"Whew. Uncle, I'm off to Spain."
I will call you for the chi spell
once I find out which demon we're dealing with.
Take the armor. It could be of some use.
But you have to discover what magic it holds.
How can I do that if you take it with you?
(Stammers)
Festive.
"I'm telling you, Pamplona's famous for somethin'."
It must be the paella.
"Oh, the thing they whack with a stick till candy comes out?"
"That would be a piata, ratso."
"This is Spain, not Mexico."
(Grunts)
I know this place is famous for somethin'.
"Shendu: Soon it will be famous for the return of dai gui,"
the earth demon.
"No, it won't."
(TV plays quietly)
"Uncle: Jade, TV is too loud."
(Turns down volume)
Still too loud!
Grrr...
I can hear the electricity in the wires. Unplug!
(Sighs) I wish there was a way to unplug <i> uncle.</i>
There's gotta be a chill-pill potion in here.
"Call uncle a lumberjack, 'cause he's gonna be sawing logs."
"Jade, the books are laughing at me."
¶ Not for long ¶
"tea, dear uncle?"
Yes.
"Blaaaah! Jade, this tea"
tastes like it was brewed with beard of goat.
One more thing-- it is bitter.
One more thing-- it is cold!
One more thing--
(yawning)
(Snores)
Hotcha.
Hmm...
-Hak foo? -Here I am.
Chan!
Spanish mackerel technique!
Unh! Ohh!
"Shendu: Stop him, you fop."
"I'm trying, you old dragon."
Aah!
Shendu: Without touching the good magic.
(Both grunt)
Valmont: I've got it.
"Shendu: No, you fool. It's good magic."
Shendu: Get it.
Gorilla grip. Ohh.
(People yelling)
"Do you hear that, chan?"
The earth demon has been released.
"How can that be the earth demon, you baboon?"
The portal remains to be opened.
(Yelling)
That's what Pamplona's famous for--
(rumbling)
The running of the bulls.
Yaaahhh!
Shendu: The box!
Huh? What? Oh.
Yaaahh!
Uhh! Uhh! Ohh!
Hoo-aaahhhh!
Mouse runs through maze!
(Grunting)
<i>Hasta luego!</i>
Wha? Huh?
Mouse takes cheese.
(Snoring)
So...How deep is the sleep?
(Clang)
Yea deep. (Telephone rings)
- Uncle's rare finds. May I help you? - Jade?
Jackie! How's Spain? You get a chance
to wear that smelly old armor yet?
"No, but I did get a chance"
to be bowlegged and saddle-sore.
Let me speak with uncle.
(Snoring)
Uncle's taking a nap.
"Oh, that's wonderful!"
(Stammering) No. Wake him up.
I need uncle here in Spain immediately.
Errrr...He...Uh...
Just went into the bathroom. You know how he gets
when you interrupt his private time.
I'll give him the message.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh-huh.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Earth demon?!
"Uh, mm-hmm. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah."
"Chi spell. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ok. I'll tell him."
And how long
does the deep sleep spell last?
"Wake up! Wake up, wake up, wake up!"
(Sighs)
(Snores)
We should have forced uncle to count sheep.
"Sheep! Tohru, you are da bomb!"
I'll use the sheep talisman
to astro-project myself into rip Van uncle's dreams.
"Where you will tell him about the earth demon,"
and he will offer you...
A chi spell.
Incoming!
Whoa. Sheep again.
Jade. How happy I am to see you!
You are?
You are my favorite person
in the whole wide world.
You're not uncle. What've you done with him?
Heh heh heh!
"Oh, oh, Jade, you are such a card."
Heh heh heh.
(Uncle hums cheerfully)
Ha ha ha ha ha!
¶ Hee hee hee hee-hee hee-hee ¶
it's only a dream.
It's only a dream.
Just give me the ingredients to cast a spell
"against the earth demon, and you can go"
back to being all weird. Ok?
"Oh, must I think about demons?"
Happy thoughts.
Only happy thoughts.
Uncle! I need the chi spell! Now!
O...K... Little miss cranky.
First you need the symbol of the immortal
who originally defeated the earth demon.
And that would be?
A flower!
Second...
(Yawning)
You need the key ingredient
found - in every chi spell--
hair of ewe.
Didn't know my hair was so potent.
And third?
"For that, I must do research."
(Yawns) After a nap.
Uncle!
Uncle!
- Grrr! - Well?
Grab Mr. happypants.
We're flying to Spain.
"""Mr. happypants""?"
But what if uncle does not wake in time to cast the chi spell?
We have a long flight to catch up on our <i> research!</i>
Black: Black.
Captain black.
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
"Sorry, Jackie. Company softball game."
Guess who hit a home run.
"You did? Oh, congratula--oh. No."
"Listen, I need help from satellite surveillance."
I have lost valmont's trail.
"Shendu: So good to see you out and about, dai gui."
Rahrr...
Too many flowers.
"Dai gui does not like ""pretty."""
My kingdom must be submerged
into the depths of the earth.
Do not stand there!
Start digging!
D-d...Digging?
"Shendu: We would be most happy to assist,"
"burliest of brothers, but..."
"We have other portals to seek,"
family to release.
Rahrrr...
"Very well, then."
The dirty work shall be mine alone.
Yaaahh! Aaahhh! Aaahhh!
Yaaahhh! Aaahhh! Aaahhh!
Hak foo: Antelope flee raging bull!
Ratso: Land shark!
Hmm?
Bwaahh!
Gahh!
Yeee-ohhhhh!
"Yohh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Oh, ow!"
Gooww!
Rahrrr...
You are either a very large grub
or this Jackie chan
of whom all demons speak.
Grub. Grub.
"Consider yourself buried, Jackie chan!"
Yaaahh!
Nnaaahhhh!
(Panting fearfully)
What do I have to lose?
"If you have powers,"
now would be a good time to demonstrate!
Look what <i> I</i> found.
Raahhrr!
Grub...Or flatworm?
Hah...Hah hah... Hah--huh?
Hup!
Didn't feel a thing.
(Snoring)
We got all the chi ingredients.
We're golden.
"Good, because it does not seem"
the sleep spell will wear off anytime soon.
"About that little screwup, t..."
Maybe Jackie doesn't need to know about sleeping beauty here?
But...How can Jackie <i>not</i> notice?
Earthquake?
Earth <i> demon.</i>
Raahhhrrr!
Raaahhhrrr!
Unhh!
Arrhh! Yarhh! Rahhrr!
Jackie!
Uncle!
Raahhrr!
Whoops.
Raahhrr!
Uncle! - You look rested.
Did you bring the chi spell?
(Snoring)
Yes!
Where is it? Ow!
Uh...Uncle needs preparation time.
I will keep dai gui busy.
Uhhhh!
Arrhhh!
I shall shell you of that armor.
I bet that you are soft inside...
Like a lichee nut.
Nnn...Uncle! Hurry!
Huh?
(Snoring)
Nnn...Gnhh...Duhh!
Uncle! This is no time for a nap!
"No sweat, Jackie. We're just about ready to chi."
<i>You</i> made the chi spell?
Talk later!
And now for the hair of me.
Jade! The spell!
"Hit it, t!"
(Chanting like uncle)
(Chanting)
(Repeating)
Ohhh!
(Chuckles embarrassedly)
Aim still needs work.
No portal has opened.
The chi spell did not work.
Mmm...But... I followed the instructions!
Ohhh...
Dai gui does not like flowers.
"Oh, no!"
(Uncle yawning)
(Yawning)
"Good morning, Jade!"
Raahhrrr!
Aiyaaaahhh!
"Uncle, we have the ingredients."
What are we doing wrong?
I see no hair of ewe.
"I keep plucking, I'm gonna get a bald spot."
"No, Jade. Ewe. A female sheep."
"Well, there's plenty of those... In your dreams."
Wool?
(Frantic chanting)
(Joins in chanting)
(Chanting continues)
(Frantic chanting)
Uhh...Raaahhhh...
Uhhh!
Here comes my favorite part.
Dai gui: Nooooooo...
Ooooooo...
"How are you feeling, uncle?"
Very well... Thank you.
Except for the demon screaming in my face!
One more thing!
I told you the armor was good armor!
One more thing!
You should never question uncle!
You should've made uncle's tea stronger.
He is still cranky.
I don't think
there's enough tea in China
to simmer uncle down.
But I'll take Mr. sourpuss
over Mr. happypants any ol' day.
"Hey, Jackie. How many hours a day do you work out?"
"That really depends. If I'm filming the whole day,"
at least an hour a day.
"Nothing to shoot for the next couple of days,"
then at least 3 hour a day.
After you train so hard...
"Ok, I have to watch..."
My diet.
Nothing...Important... Than health.
"Jade, captain black pulled strings"
to get you a seat in the dugout.
Why aren't you watching the game?
"T'ch, and miss the real excitement?"
You mean danger. The dark hand is here somewhere
looking for a demon portal.
"So, if they open, you just toot the flute"
"and high-fly the demon out of the park,"
back where he belongs.
"Do you have everything you need for the sky demon chi spell, uncle?"
"Bat wing dust, lotus oil,"
"hummingbird saliva, root beer."
Root beer?
Sorry. Mine.
"Oh, that's your fifth soda."
One for every Fenway frank.
Had to wash 'em down with something.
I do not know where she puts it all.
"Ooh, pit stop."
You have to do this now?
Hello... 5 sodas.
"Whoa, boss. We can't go where no man has gone before."
"We are not going in, fool."
"Hsi wu, the sky demon, is coming out."
Jade.
Jade.
"Tohru, we must prepare the chi spell."
Jade!
¶ Ta-da-da-da-da-da ¶
charge!
I'm sorry. I'll pay for these later. Thank you.
Get your programs?
Foul!
Uncle.
Hold your horses!
"Welcome back, hsi wu."
"(Bat hits ball, crowd cheers)"
The crowd roars for me?
Uncle...
Hehhhhh...
Hyahhhh! Hyah!
Ahh...
Get...Back...In.
"Come on, come on, come on."
About time.
(Chi chanting)
The old man.
(Uncle continues chanting)
Add these to our bill.
(Humming)
"I am never going back, mortal."
(Uncle still chanting)
It appears I am here to stay.
"Jade's been in the dugout, but she's back in the game."
Aah!
Ow.
(Hissing)
"Jade, don't open the door."
Duh!
Now?
Please.
(Plays)
(Grunts)
Ewww...
Retrieve my tail.
It didn't work.
Of course it did not work. The demon is out of range.
The tail.
"I don't care if you are wearing a dress, valmont."
You are not going in the little girls' room.
Ach...Ahh...
"Captain black, aren't you out of your jurisdiction?"
Let's just say we love the Red Sox.
Jackie...
Check it out.
(Gremlin sounds)
Aiyaaaa!
"Jackie, restrain the tail."
"Ooh, I'm trying, uncle."
"Aiy, aiy, aiy!"
"I don't think it likes you, Jackie."
Oh.
"Ooh-hoo, get it off. Get it off of me."
"The tail seeks its owner: Hsi wu, the sky demon."
Hotcha.
(Gremlin sounds cease)
This box is now protected by a chi spell.
Bad magic cannot touch it.
Until we devise a way to use the tail to our advantage...
We must be very cautious.
This chi powder will also keep any demon from entering...
Unless they are invited.
Ow. (Hisses)
"So, I need an invitation, do I?"
"Hey, Jade, you going to the spring dance Friday night?"
Was thinking about it.
"Well, who you gonna go with, a ninja?"
"Or do you only fight 'em? Hyah, hyah, hyah!"
"T'ch, you're a riot, drew."
(Laughter)
"Hey, drew, who you gonna with, your mother?"
(Stammers) N-no. I--I--I...
Mama's boy.
"Thanks, uh..."
I'm hsi w...S-s-Seymour wu...Jahoositz.
Jade chan. You must be new.
"Yeah, I just flew into town. So, Jade, is it true?"
Of course. What?
Do you really fight ninjas?
You bet.
And Jackie was knocking them off the roller-coaster tracks.
That is so awesome.
"T'ch, that was nothing."
"Lately, Jackie's been taking on way worse than ninjas."
Like what?
"Well, you probably won't believe this,"
"but yesterday, we captured part of a demon."
No way.
Way. Wanna see it?
You bet.
(Dings)
"Uh, maybe we shouldn't."
I wouldn't wanna get you into trouble.
"T'ch, trouble follows me. Come on in."
Ok.
I guarantee you've never seen anything like this.
"You'd be surprised, Jade."
"Freaky, huh?"
"Jade, what are you doing?"
(Gasps)
And who are you?
"Uncle, what's going on?"
"Jade opened the box with the ""you know what"" inside."
"Jade, you know you're not supposed to open the box"
"with the ""you know what"" inside."
"Jade, didn't open it. I did."
"Hmm, bad magic cannot touch good."
"Show me your burn marks, demon boy."
"I didn't mean to cause any trouble, sir."
"I just wanted to see the ""you know what"" inside."
(Grumbles)
This is Seymour.
Hi. Hello.
"Well, it was nice meeting everybody."
This friend of Jade's is too polite.
"Uncle, Jade finally has a friend her own age."
This could keep her away from portals and demons.
"Seymour, thanks for taking the hit."
Nobody's ever done that for me.
"Hey, what are friends for?"
"Well, see you tomorrow?"
Probably.
(Sighs)
"Ow. Until tomorrow, then."
Seymour's loads more fun than any of the other kids at school.
"We like the same things, and he actually listens to me."
"We're like yin and Yang, Yang and yin."
Good and evil?
Left and right. 2 parts of the same whole. Duh.
I'm just not sure if Seymour knows it.
Why don't you ask him to the school dance?
Eww...Like on a date? We're friends.
"Besides, what if he says no?"
"Since the tail wants to find its owner,"
I will coat it with the proper chi spell ingredients...
Then release it and let it lead us to hsi wu...
"Where it will reattach, infusing the demon with the chi spell..."
Which I will activate by blowing the flute.
Aiyaah!
Blow only once the tail attaches.
"What's all that, uncle?"
Mung bean sandwiches for the trip.
Trip?
The sky demon could be halfway around the globe by now.
"So, we going inside to study?"
Maybe later.
I--I have something I wanna give you first.
See? It's a friendship medallion.
"You know, 2 halves of the same coin."
"Gee, I'd love to see how I-- how we look in them."
Do you have a mirror inside?
You really like it?
You can wear it to the spring dance.
"I'd wear mine, but I don't know if I'm going. Are you?"
"Me? Why would I-- well, actually,"
"I was thinking about going,"
but I need to call my mother first and get her permission.
I guess I'll have to go inside to use your phone.
No prob.
We got a dog?
"Interesting camouflage, uncle."
I smell a spell.
Strike.
"Ahh, hsi wu. I told you I did not like him."
You're...You're...
A demon? Still wanna go to the dance with me?
Not. Unh.
No! After the tail attaches.
Ohh!
Yeee!
"You will remove the spell from my tail, dear uncle,"
or perish.
Jackie: Uncle!
"Jade, go back to section 13."
But this is personal.
All the more reason.
Promise me.
Grrr...Promise.
"What have you done to my tail, sly uncle?"
Ancient proverb-- none of your beeswax.
I am in no mood for games.
"Now remove your spell from my tail,"
or you will wish you had wings.
What is hexed cannot be unhexed.
Then cast another spell. Ow!
How can I cast a spell without my spell books?
Ohh...
Hsi wu went this way.
We need wings to find uncle.
The sky demon.
My mistake.
Shoo.
Mung bean.
From uncle's sandwich?
A trail of mung beans.
Fight fire with fire.
Find yin with Yang.
"Greetings, brother wu."
Did you bring them?
The geezer's books. Right here.
Nosebleed city.
"Well, you have your texts. Seek a spell."
These are not my reading glasses.
Grrr...
Gaah!
"Uncle, run."
Where to?
Get chan!
(Grunts)
Huh? What the--
"hey, friend. Wanna dance?"
Let's.
Hyah!
Ohh!
You! But how?
Talisman math:
Levitation plus speed equals flight.
Ahh...Jade! What are you--
how did you-- where did you--
talk later.
Gaah! Unh!
Owwwww...
Unh. Jackie... Zipper is stuck!
My tail.
Aiyeeeaaahhh!
"Ahh, uncle!"
"Ah, thank you."
"Jade, you must release hsi wu's tail."
You got it.
Uncle's cool.
I'll find my own spell.
Mine.
Grrr...
Ha ha. Nougat.
Unh. It won't open.
Aah!
"The choice is yours, Jackie chan."
Crash or burn.
(Strains)
Yes.
"Jackie, time to toot."
I want my tail.
All yours.
"No, wait."
Aah!
(Uncle chanting)
Tails...You lose.
(Chanting chi)
Once more with feeling.
(Really blows)
"So long, Seymour."
I told you that boy was too polite.
"Uncle, shh, shh. I'm sorry, Jade."
I know you wanted to go to the dance tonight.
"T'ch, so I could do the funky chicken with a demon?"
Dream on.
"(Sighs) You were right about the good and evil thing, t."
"There will be other dances, Jade."
Dance schmance. I am so over Seymour.
I just miss having someone around who listens.
Hmm...
Someone like you.
Yin and Yang. Big and small.
You and me.
"-Hey, Jackie, -yes"
what do you like to put on your pizza?
One--only one kind-- pepperoni.
Double pepperoni. Very thin one.
"And well, well done. And very hot."
That's all. Yeah.
"Hurry, Jackie!"
I know.
We mustn't allow shendu
to release the water demon.
"No, hurry!"
Uncle's legs are getting a big cramp!
"Join us, sister dearest."
(Screeches)
"Whoa, fish outta water."
"At last, liberation!"
"And now, - for some libation..."
Which will require moister climes than this.
Uh-uh-uh...
Now that I have opened
"the last portal, sister bai tza,"
it is time to liberate me
from my prison of flesh.
Gah!
You dare request your freedom?
Have I not earned it?
"As promised, I have released"
all our brothers and sisters.
"How curious, then,"
that 6 demon sorcerers remain trapped in the void!
I should obliterate you on their behalf.
(Gasps)
I held my part of the bargain.
You cannot blame me for the meddlings
of Jackie chan.
(Engine)
Speaking of whom...
"(Gasps) Quick, uncle! The chi spell!"
"(Struggles) Jackie, I am stuck."
I will not repeat the mistakes of the others!
"Finn: Chariot race is over, chan."
It's gladiator time!
Strength and honor.
Uhh. Ech. My suit!
"Uncle, get in."
Ohhh.
(Growls)
Is it over?
Am I free of shendu?
"Uh, the mermaid said no deal, big v."
Uhh!
"Quick, uncle. The chi spell!"
(Chants)
"Your spells may have quelled my siblings,"
but I am the slippery one.
Aah!
(Slowed chanting)
Aah!
(Jittery chanting)
(Gasps)
(Honk honk)
"Jade: Well, guess we won't be needing"
that chi spell after all.
"Don't be so sure, Jade."
Eh...Jade!
I thought I told you to stay with...
Tohru.
She is - very persuasive.
"Uhh, help me out."
I must cast the chi spell.
<i>Mamma Mia!</i>
Aah!
(Quickly chanting)
Uhh!
Uncle: The water demon will return
to her undersea empire.
"Then, not even my most powerful chi spell"
will stop her.
So forget the books.
Let's pack our flippers and--uhh!
Research!
Bai tza's empire is also known
as the lost continent of Atlantis.
Atlantis?
I thought it was merely a myth.
No one has ever been able to find it.
"Heh. Hence the ""lost"" part."
My empire lies in ruins!
"Time has done its worst,"
which means it is time
for me to claim a new empire.
"Wearing the skirt is demeaning enough, shendu..."
But this is over the line!
Shendu: Do you think I am pleased
"with our union, valmont?"
"If I am to remain in your pathetic body,"
I must at least make a few cosmetic improvements.
Now hold still while I sprout our tail.
Valmont: You'll do nothing of the--
shendu: Do not try to--
valmont: I'll fight you with every last--
shendu: And you will lose!
Shendu!
"Good madam, free me of shendu."
I beg you.
Look what he did to my head!
Oh!
My answer to you and my sniveling brother remains...
No.
Hoo-hoo. Nasty piranha.
Bai tza: You!
"Who, him?"
Huh!
"(Chuckles) Hey, you're a fish. I'm Finn."
We're simpatico--unh!
Direct me to a suitable new empire.
"Uh, <i> mi casa es su casa,</i>"
your amphibiousness.
A fish cannery?
See your point.
"Well, there's lots of nice places"
"here in San Fran,"
and it's all by the water.
"Yeah, great town."
Mm...Except for the quakes.
Earthquakes?
"Uh, that's right."
The San Andreas fault runs right through downtown.
Better idea...
You should move to the east coast.
Uhh!
So be it.
Your San Fran shall be the cradle
of my new undersea empire.
"Uh, but isn't your undersea empire"
"supposed to be, you know..."
Undersea?
And so it shall be...
Once I sink this city.
She's gonna sink the city?
"Uh, can we be excused, shendu?"
"Yeah, seein' as how we opened"
all the portals for ya. Heh heh.
You don't need us to carry
old pan ku anymore.
Never seeing any of you ever again
would make me a very happy dragon.
Say bye-bye to valmont.
Finn: I hear Utah's nice this time of year.
Chow: Anywhere but here.
"Valmont: Weren't you listening, shendu?"
"If we stay here, we will drown."
Shendu: Not if we have gills.
Valmont: If you change so much
"as another hair on my head, I'll--"
shendu: You will what?
Do not be a fool.
The pan ku box is forged of good magic.
You know we cannot touch it.
"Valmont: No, <i> you</i> cannot touch it."
Aaaaah!
Uhh.
(Gasps) My face... He's gone.
He's gone! He's--
out cold.
I found Atlanta.
Does that count?
"Uncle, this is impossible."
Scientists have been trying to find Atlantis
for centuries.
(Bell jingles)
(Gasps)
Good evening.
What do you want?
Shh. You will wake shendu.
He's napping?
I rendered him unconscious.
"Now please, you must help me."
I want him exorcised!
Like we're gonna help shendu
get in shape!
"Ex-or-cised, Jane."
He wants to remove shendu's spirit
from his body.
But why should we help you?
Because there is nothing
that either of us wants more
than to be rid of that blasted fire demon.
A dark hand trick.
N-no tricks. I will tell you anything you want to know.
"Uh, our hideout..."
It's the helms fish cannery.
"That's nice,"
but we have bigger fish to fry.
"Like finding the demon you unleashed, remember?"
Unh...She's in San Francisco!
Bai tza?
Here? Where?
(Clears throat)
"You scratch my back, I scratch yours."
Hmm. Hmmmm...
(Gags)
Bai tza's planning to sink San Francisco
by causing an earthquake?
But how?
Just because I am possessed by a demon
doesn't mean I can read their minds.
She would need to jar the fault
with an explosion or--
a flood.
"Tea, <i> sensei?</i>"
Thank you.
"Valmont: Jolly good, tohru."
I would love a spot.
(Growls)
"Uhh, right, then."
This <i> han zi</i> àwill suppress shendu's spirit
until I am able to concoct
a true exorcism spell.
"Well, it's more becoming than a horn, I suppose."
"Tohru, you must go with Jackie to cast"
the water demon's chi spell.
"Yes, <i> sensei.</i>"
Ta-ta. Best of luck.
Come with us.
Awesome!
"Not you, Jade."
You.
Aww.
But...
The exorcism spell.
You have resources.
We need them.
"It's a big city, chan."
Jackie: I am following what we know
to be the path of the fault line
for any sign of bai tza...
"That is, unless you have any better ideas?"
"Just like old times, eh, tohru?"
(Growls)
"I recommend you watch your back, chan."
"Tohru turned coat on me, you remember?"
You forced me to fight a demon.
"Oh, yes, that's completely different"
from what chan has you doing.
Jackie: Shh!
Down!
"1, 2..."
(Battle cries)
Hyah!
Heh. Thought you guys looked fishy.
So this is why your niece
is always with you.
And here I just thought
you were horribly irresponsible.
"Jade, how did--"
had section 13 hook me up
with satellite surveillance. Duh.
Bai!
"And good-bye to you, Jade."
No. Bai tza!
Why embarcadero station?
Perhaps she's hopping Bart
to the bay aquarium.
(Chanting)
I have seen such symbols in uncle's books
used for summoning spells.
What's she trying to summon?
Enough water for a flood?
"The station's lower levels are underground,"
closer to the fault.
And I can't imagine the subway system was built
to withstand the crushing pressure
of raging floodwaters.
"Quickly, tohru. The chi spell!"
I need preparation time.
I will run interference.
(Chanting)
Safe!
(Screams)
Aaaaah!
How nice to just stand back
and watch chan work.
I must be within range.
"If Jade does not remain safe,"
I will turn you inside out.
(Nervous) Ah ha ha ha.
"I wont let her out of my sight, old chap."
Aah!
Uhh!
Uh-uh-uh.
Stay right here with uncle valmont.
(Growls)
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
(Both chanting respective spells)
Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaah!
Uhh!
I hate fish.
Where is... The gourd!
Lose something?
Oof!
Hyah!
(Struggles)
I want to hold your hand.
Oof!
(Angry roar)
"Uncle, we need another gourd."
"And while you're at it,"
we need to break a water-summoning spell.
Aiyaaa!
Too many spells!
"Um, and how's that exorcism spell coming?"
(Angry roar)
I'm going for the gourd.
(Deep breath)
"Welcome to my world, chan!"
Whoa!
Jackie!
"Funny, I'm not sure who to root for."
Ow!
Go Jackie.
Go valmont.
And ruin my Italian shoes?
And keep shendu for a roommate?
"Oh, all right."
(Battle cry)
"You dare to betray me, shendu?"
"Yes, he does."
I insist you remove him from me at once
and give him a trouncing.
Ohh!
(Gasps) Valmont?
Ahh...Chan?!
"They've been playing tricks on you, brother."
Then they shall suffer a dragon's fury!
Aaah!
(Choking coughs)
(Water draining)
Aah!
(Chanting)
¶ Uncle broke your spe-ell ¶
(chants)
Aah!
Uncle! Exorcism!
(Snarls)
We scared him off!
"Uncle, you did not remove"
shendu from valmont--ow!
With what spell?
Too many interruptions!
I had to concoct
anti-water-summoning spell first!
So bai tza and shendu remain at large.
"Jackie, hello?"
You just saved the city from the big one!
She will return.
"And when she does,"
we'll hook her like a trout.
Now come on.
I say we treat you to a pan ku breakfast.
Pan ku...
I meant pancake. Duh!
"Now <i> that</i> sounds good, Jade."
I can sell these
"hey, Jackie. Are you a good swimmer?"
"No, I'm--"
I'm...Very bad.
I do swim in the private pool.
"First time I went to the deep sea,"
"you know, on the boat, I was like..."
"When we stopped, we had to go to the beach."
Everybody jumped.
"One by one jumped. I say, ""they jump?"
"I jump."" You know, I jumped down,"
but I come into-- (Gasps)
I'm scared about swimming.
Nice day for a Tsunami.
Too nice.
Why here?
The water demon will need a palace
from which to rule her new undersea kingdom.
"Here she comes, uncle."
Bai tza.
"Uncle: Jackie, take the gourd."
I will prepare the <i> chi</i> spell.
Right--wah!
Jade?
"Uh, no. I'm a moose."
Marlon moose.
"Jade, you were supposed to wait back at section 13."
(Scoffs) I've been at every demon send-off so far.
Did you really think I was gonna sit out the last one?
"Besides, then we can sell our story to reality TV."
Shall I turn back?
"No. Please, just keep out of harm's way."
(Chanting)
The <i> chi</i> wizard!
No!
"Ooh, fish fry. Yah!"
Jade!
Jackie!
"Uncle, we have to get Jade!"
You have to re-open the portal!
"The <i> chi</i> spell has sealed the portal,"
like it has sealed all the others...
Forever.
(Hiss)
Uh-uh-uh.
Uhh! Uhh!
"Uhh! Hurry, uncle! We must fly to Rome."
"Jade is not in Rome, Jackie."
She is trapped in the demon netherworld.
"Oh, why couldn't it have been me?"
Aah!
"There must be something we can do, uncle!"
A counter spell! A stronger spell!
Some way to--ow!
I cannot think with all your noise.
The eighth door.
Uncle?
We have permanently sealed
"7 portals belonging to 7 demon sorcerers,"
but not the one belonging to shendu.
It is Jade's only hope of escape
from the demon realm.
But how do we find shendu's door?
There is only one way.
The pan ku box.
But shendu has it. How do we find him?
Our hideout!
It's the helms fish cannery!
Oh.
Uncle: Quickly. We must find the eighth door
before the demons find Jade.
"Jade: ""The demon netherworld:"
"""Where demon sorcerers go when they've been bad,"
"where no human has gone before...Until now."""
My ratings will be huge!
(Sighs) If I ever find a way out of here.
Uhh! Long way down.
Whoa!
Whoa.
We have liftoff.
(Snoring)
Hsi wu: Sister po!
Uh-oh.
Sister po!
(Snorts) Hmm? Dinner time?
Meeting time.
Our sister bai has returned.
I see.
"Well, perhaps she brought hors d'oeuvres."
"Mmm, I love the taste of humans."
"Oh, boy."
Over here!
"Double oh, boy."
"Shendu: You may take your leave, hak foo."
Valmont's voice: I order you to stay!
Shendu's voice: Leave!
Valmont: Stay!
Shendu: Leave! - Valmont: Stay!
Shendu: Leave! - Valmont: Stay!
Shendu: Leave! - Valmont: Stay!
Shendu: Your ruffian has outlasted
"his usefulness to me, valmont."
Get rid of him.
Valmont: And be left alone with you?
"I think not, shendu."
"On the contrary, the both of you..."
Are far from alone.
"Shendu: Brothers and sisters,"
so good to see you.
"Your sentiment will quickly subside, shendu..."
Once your punishment is underway.
P-p-punishment?
Before I've finished securing your release?
And how do you plan to do that
with all of our portals permanently sealed?
Yeah. How?
"Why, through my portal, dear sister."
The eighth portal?
It remains unsealed.
All I need do is unlock it
"with the pan ku box,"
a task for which I have retained the services
"of a mortal servant,"
who may touch good magic.
Grr.
"What is mine is yours, demon brethren."
Uhh...Uhh.
Uhh.
Uhh!
"What in the netherworld is wrong with you, po Kong?"
Uhh...Itch. Cannot reach.
"Hsi wu, scratch your sister's back"
so we may get on with our meeting.
Uhh. There's a lot of back.
Could take a while.
"So, you want a back scratcher?"
Ahhh...
It passed.
"Now, about the eighth door, shendu."
It is the portal of <i> your</i> banishment.
Only <i> you</i> may pass through it.
"That once was true, bai tza,"
"but now that I am a spirit,"
my portal is vacant...
Waiting to be filled by others.
You mean <i> another.</i>
Only one may pass through each portal.
That is the rule.
Do you think I have been dallying here?
I have discovered a spell
which will keep the portal open
until the last of you is freed.
"In fact, I was just preparing to journey to it"
when you called.
Hak foo...
Bring me...
The pan ku box!
Shark snatches bait!
Bai tza: What shark?
Xiao fung: What is he talking about?
Jackie!
"Shendu, what is happening?"
"Uh, hak foo always sounds the gong as we take our leave,"
which reminds me...
See you all at my portal!
Shendu!
Can he be trusted?
Of course not!
Yet we have no other options.
But all of eternity to punish him
should he again deceive us.
Hsi wu: Then let us go to the eighth door.
Yes...Let's.
Hyah! Hyah!
Ohh...Ohh!
"Why the interest in the box, chan?"
You have sealed the portals.
I want a keepsake of our time together.
Hyah!
Uhh!
Unh!
Jackie: Uhh!
Buffalo tramples field mouse!
(Hisses)
"You want the box, shendu?"
It's yours!
Aah!
Uhh!
(Groans)
Angry crow takes--
unh! (Sighs)
What is taking so long?!
Let's go.
"Uncle: In ancient times,"
shendu ruled what is now China.
I'm betting that that is where we will find his portal.
But even <i> if</i> we are able to make this box
"provide the portal's location,"
how will Jade find it from the demon side?
With proper guidance.
That is why I have brought research.
"Ohh, nothing."
Ahh...
Jade is good at puzzles.
She could figure it out...
If she were here.
Uhh.
Uhh.
Uhh.
(Sighs)
I thought this rock looked familiar.
I'm going 'round in circles!
Valmont: And we are on our way to China why?
Chan has stolen the pan ku box.
"Clearly, he wants to find my portal so he can seal it."
Now why would chan go to all the trouble
if he knows you don't need the portal to pass between the realms?
"For good measure, I suppose."
"Meanwhile, my brothers and sisters"
are expecting me to open my door and free them.
I brought your spell book.
"You brought the phone book, you simpleton!"
I was bluffing!
So there is no way to free all of them.
Of course there is!
I...Just need to find it...
That's all.
Uncle: Hotcha!
Uncle?
He is in a trance.
He's looking for Jade.
Day number...
"Ohh, I haven't the foggiest."
The good news: The demons have left
to find the eighth portal.
The bad news: I lost their trail.
"Jackie, toru, uncle."
"I may never see you again,"
"but in case you ever find this footage,"
edit this mushy part out before you sell it to a TV show.
Just want you all to know I miss you.
I even miss uncle's garlic breath.
Jade!
Aah!
Uncle? How did you--
"not important,"
and garlic is <i> good</i> for you!
Are you ok?
(Scoffs) Just lost.
Listen closely.
We are trying to find the eighth door.
Shendu's door!
You know about that?
"The demons are looking for it, too."
Shendu told them he's gonna open it up
so they can all break out.
(Gasps) Shendu deceives them.
"Only one being can now exit through that portal,"
and that being must be you.
"So how do I find the portal, uncle?"
"When I know where it is, I will lead you there myself."
"Go, uncle."
One more thing: I cannot know where it is
unless I know how the pan ku box works.
Jackie said you are good with puzzles.
Hmm...
Those little lines on the pan ku box!
The tri-grams?
"Yeah, those!"
Tell Jackie the tri-grams must be the key!
"I will do that, Jade!"
Time flies
when you're waiting for a cell door to open.
Where's my camera?
"Oh, Jade..."
"Say ""chi spell."""
Uhh!
The tri-grams must be the key.
What could Jade mean?
"Shendu's tri-gram representing ""fire"""
is a broken line between 2 solid lines.
The tri-grams could be a morse code.
Or the combination to a lock.
If a solid line is a half turn...
And the broken lines are quarter turns...
(Sighs)
"Um, perhaps the unbroken lines"
tell us to turn it the long way?
Half...
Quarter...
Quarter...
Half...
Jade knows her puzzles.
And I know my demons!
Shendu's portal is in Hong Kong.
"Jackie: Nothing yet, uncle."
"According to the pan ku box,"
the eighth door should lie just beyond this tunnel.
Oh! It is near!
You have to be kidding.
It is as if Jade herself guided us here.
Jackie: Hong Kong moose world.
Uncle: I will alert Jade.
"Hsi wu: Brothers and sisters,"
I bring you the mortal called...
Jade!
"Mmm, yummy!"
Uh...
"If you think you're <i> all</i> getting out,"
"well, I hate to break it to ya,"
but shendu's lying.
Only <i> one</i> of you can go through the portal.
End of story.
How do <i> you</i> know?
Uncle told me.
The chi wizard?
So shendu <i>did</i> deceive us.
There's a surprise.
"So, uh..."
Which one of you is it gonna be?
Surely there must be a simple way to resolve this.
"Like what, alphabetical order?"
Jade awaits us!
We must open the portal immediately!
Shendu: So that is why you wanted the box!
"Well, I assure you, chan, the only thing emerging from my portal..."
Will be a demon.
Hyah!
Gorilla grip!
Unh!
Jackie!
There is more than one way to skin a cat!
And 2 ways to open a portal!
(Chanting)
The symbol of the immortal who defeated me!
Sword slays dragon.
Aah!
Brothers and sisters!
Bai tza: The portal!
Every demon for himself!
Unh!
Age before beauty.
Unh!
Hsi wu?
"One goes through, that's the rule."
No!
Uhh!
Uhh! Jade!
Did you miss me?
Not at all.
Uncle: Jade.
Dai gui: That is number eight.
Tso LAN: Which would make us fresh out of portals.
"Hsi wu: Say, ""chi spell."""
Perhaps we should seek a tear
in the time-space continuum?
All 8 portals are finally sealed...
Forever!
Whippee!
"He's gone! He's gone, gone, gone!"
"I've got my body back,"
¶ la Dee da Dee da ¶
"¶ boom-shaka-laka-laka, boom-shaka-laka-laka ¶"
"¶ oh, I've got my body back ¶"
"can we, Jackie?"
We're not really...
"You're kind of early, but..."
Awww--
(like bullwinkle) Welcome to moose world!
Hyuk!
Through - the portal we go.
Yay!
It's gone. I've got my body back! (Cheers)
"Hey Jackie, do you play an instrument?"
"Yes, I do. Harmonica,"
"when I was very, very young..."
And also I know how to play...
Chinese guitar.
(Humming)
But now I forget.
But I do sing.
"Yeah...Actually, I'm a pretty good singer."
Surprise!
Jade. - Jade.
"Mom, dad!"
Hope you don't mind us dropping in uninvited.
Cousin Jackie.
It's so good to see you again.
You have been such a wonderful role model for Jade.
"Oh, well, thank you. I--ow!"
You take credit for my good influence?
Uncle! - Uncle! Uncle!
Is uncle everyone's uncle?
He's actually our cousin.
Aren't you?
What brings you all to Hong Kong?
We've banished the last demon.
Demon?! - Demon?!
Uh...
"Uh, right."
"Uh, the demon is the name of a roller coaster"
at the new Hong Kong moose world.
Look at the cool watch Jackie got me there.
"Watch: Hey, hey, hey! I'm Marlon moose."
Oh.
"Please, have a seat. We will make tea."
Wipe your feet.
"Easy, t. If mom and dad find out about all this demon stuff,"
there's no way they'll let me stay with Jackie.
"Ah, ancient history. The portals are sealed,"
the demons have been banished...
Even shendu is no more.
Aah!
Stop!
"What is it now, shendu?!"
"Admittedly, I have failed you, my siblings."
Aah!
But I may yet save you as well.
"We can all regain our freedom,"
"and even reclaim the centuries wasted in this void,"
if you allow me to pursue one last recourse.
Ha! And that would be?
The <i> book of ages.</i>
(All gasp)
Ludicrous.
Even <i> we</i> never dared to tamper with that.
You risk altering the very fabric of reality.
"Am I to assume <i> this</i> reality pleases you, sister?"
Hmm. These are desperate times.
Then I will make things right.
All you need do is allow me to once more
depart from this realm and possess a human.
The right human.
More tea?
Oh.
Jackie?
(Gasps) My tea cup!
"Quickly, before it stains."
Shendu: A broken tea cup is the least of--
a dem--
"well, this was fun. Gotta go."
You are leaving? So soon?
"We'll be back. It's just, um, Jackie's, um..."
"Allergic... Yeah, uh--"
(muffled threats)
"Um, the tea makes his eyes all red."
(Shendu struggling) What is he saying?
"Uh, thank you very much. Good-bye!"
Uhh!
Aah! - Hey.
(Both gasp) So reckless.
(Groans) Quickly.
Jade...
You are not going anywhere but to your room.
You are moving back home with us immediately!
I am?
"We are very sorry, Jade,"
but it seems it is unsafe for you
to remain with cousin Jackie.
He is clearly a troublemaker.
Jackie's not a troublemaker...
But he is in trouble.
I could not find Jackie.
"Me, neither."
(Sighs) Same here.
Jade. - Jade?
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
Jade! - Jackie?!
I'm at the airport. Shendu's flying to Australia.
Australia? Why?
Unh. He--ooh--
shendu: You will find out soon enough.
Jackie? Jackie!
"Captain black, requesting satellite surveillance"
"to track Jackie. Yeah, that's right, Jackie."
And we're gonna need a jet. A fast one.
The book is close at hand.
(Chanting)
Jackie!
Unh!
Whoa.
"Don't know what you're doin',"
but it can't be good.
(Gasps)
"Shendu: Ah, here we are."
"The <i> book of ages,</i> where all history is magically recorded."
"History lesson's over, shendu!"
Whoa--unh!
"So it is written, so it shall be."
(All gasp)
Jade. - Jade.
Mom? Dad?
What are you doing here?
"Uh, Hong Kong moose world?"
Why aren't you at the palace?
And where did you find those strange clothes?
I was gonna ask you two the same thing.
And what do you have in your hand?
(Musical fanfare plays)
Hurry. We must pay our respects.
Respects? To who?
What's going...On?
"Jade, it is forbidden. Get down."
(Gasps)
Shendu!
Shendu's alive?
I gotta tell-- (Gasps)
Jackie?
"Jackie, your hair. What are you doing?!"
Hmmph!
Your job.
Sweeping dragon doo-doo?
"Where have you been, Jade? Where is your uniform?"
"Um, why, exactly, do we have to wear uniforms?"
Because it is required of all servants
"of the supreme ruler,"
"his majestic highness, lord shendu."
Are you telling me shendu rules the world?
"Oh, of course not."
Each of the 8 emperors has his or her own domain.
Since when?
Since the Dawn of history.
What is wrong with you today?
History.
Uncle said that <i>book of ages</i>
magically recorded history.
"When shendu wrote in it, he must have rewrote the past"
"so he was never destroyed,"
and the demons were never banished through their portals.
And now... (Gasps)
I'm in demon world!
"Jackie, we gotta talk."
Jackie?
Jackie? Where'd you--whoa!
Today you must scrub master's bath chamber.
No way!
Then fill his tub with fresh muck.
Eww! (Gags)
"And it's talonsday,"
so don't forget to trim master's toenails.
"Jackie, listen to me!"
"I don't work for shendu, and neither do you."
"Demons don't rule the world, humans do."
The demons were banished into the netherworld
by the 8 immortals a long time ago.
"Then they got out, and we banished 'em again."
"But shendu possessed you, found this magic book, changed the past,"
and now none of that ever happened.
"That's crazy, Jade. You're crazy."
Humans ruling the world!
"It's true. We built cities, with cars and computers and--"
my watch. Look at my watch.
What's a watch?
"Watch: Hey, hey, hey! I'm Marlon moose."
Aah!
Magic is outlawed. You know that.
"It's not magic, it's technology."
<i>Human</i> technology. And you gave this watch to me.
But I guess you wouldn't remember that.
"Jade, if what you say is true, why <i> don't</i> I remember any of it?"
I don't know. Maybe-- (Gasps)
"""And Jade chan became a wily accomplice in the battle versus evil."""
"This is from the book, and it's about me."
"It didn't get rewritten, so neither did I."
That's why I remember.
And that's why I'm still wearing these clothes.
(Gong sounds)
"The dinner gong. Quickly, you must change into these"
before master sees you.
(Sighs) - Guess I don't exactly blend.
Better keep my life story someplace safe.
"Jackie, where'd you go?"
Jackie?
"Dance, my jesters. Dance!"
Ow! - Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Shendu: Dance!
No way.
You!
Uh...
Heh heh.
Why do you not bow?
Uh-- - oh--uh--yes--
"y-your scariness, please excuse my slow-witted niece."
Uh--unh!
"If she were not excused, she would be in flames."
Now fetch my dinner!
"Yes, master."
Jackie.
(Clears throat) Tasty treats for his glorious excellence.
"What a good slave you make, Jackie chan."
"My Joy is to serve you, master."
Mmm.
"Keeping one's enemies close is not just wise,"
it is gratifying.
"Shendu remembers the way things were, too."
Child!
"Uh, yes, master?"
It's talonsday.
Gross!
(Sighs) You forgot master's clippings.
"Jackie, there is no way I am ever going near his feet again!"
And shendu treats you like a dog on a leash.
I can't stand it.
"Well, what can I do?"
I'm just a food servant. His slave.
The Jackie chan I knew was nobody's whipping boy.
He was a hero.
He was?
"And you can be again, Jackie. Help me fix history."
Help me rewrite the book.
(Wheezing)
Which way?
But servants aren't allowed in the library.
"I told you, we aren't servants."
"Jade, be careful."
Whoa.
Ow!
Get out!
Uncle?
Only master's library boys allowed in here.
"Uncle, we need your help."
We're looking for a book.
Forbidden! These books are filled with magic.
Even I am not allowed to read them.
The <i> book of ages--</i>
never heard of it.
Are you sure?
Maybe it's over here.
"No, it is not."
How about here? Not there.
"Well, maybe over here."
No. I have been library boy for 60 years.
I am sure.
Really? - Really.
In that case...
(Gasps) Forbidden magic!
"Relax, it's just an atlas."
"If the book's not here in shendu's library,"
there's only one other place it could be.
Australia.
Oi-ya! No man's land.
That continent is forbidden.
"There is nothing there, Jade. Just a fortress."
(Scoffs) Fortresses are usually built
to protect something. Duh!
But it is said that all who approach the fortress will be destroyed.
"Well, we have to get inside it somehow."
Why?
'Cause shendu used the <i> book of ages</i>
to rewrite reality.
That is crazy.
"You do not believe her, do you?"
(Sighs) There is one thing that I believe.
Demons ruling the world is a bad thing.
"Cool. Look, uncle, I can prove I'm telling the truth."
"Watch: Hey, hey, hey! I'm Marlon moose."
Ayah!
(Scream echoing)
Shh. You will alert the--
(wind howls)
(Whispering) Shadowkhan!
She opened the book.
"Heh. Get 'em, Jackie!"
Get them?
"You know, hah! Heeyah! Hoowah! Huh! Hi-yah!"
Huh! Hi-yah!
Oh! The martial arts are outlawed.
I do not know how to fight.
Serious?
But I do know how to run!
Uhh!
Uhh! My hair!
You were due for a trim.
Wait!
This way!
"Er, this way!"
The front door.
(Both gasp)
"Uh, the side door."
Don't suppose there's a back door?
Jade: Wait for me!
Cool!
Master's magic chamber.
Entrance to this room is punishable by--uhh.
(Uncle chanting)
Huh? Uncle! (Gasps)
You saved our--ow!
What choice did I have?! You are family.
A chi spell?
Thought you weren't <i> allowed</i> to read the forbidden books.
I do not read. I--I skim.
"We must leave, uncle."
It is only a matter of time before shendu discovers
you use magic to...
Kibosh his ninjas?
But where will we go?
All aboard the Jade express to Australia.
"Oh, we are doomed!"
"Even if we escape from here,"
we have no way to journey to no man's land.
The talismans would sure help.
What talismans? What talismans?
"Uncle, let me reacquaint you with a little magic trick"
you once knew.
This'll let us grab the 12 talismans
that give shendu his magical powers.
There is no such thing!
Watch me.
Believe me now?
Chan?!
Oh!
Jackie!
Aaaahhhhh!
Jackie!
"Hey, Jackie."
Yes?
How many different dialects of Chinese do you speak?
"Oh, cantonese...Lei ho ma?"
Mandarin... (Speaking mandarin)
Chengdu... (Speaking chengdu)
Shanghai... (Speaking Shanghai)
Thai... (Speaking thai)
Very good Korean. Ok English...How are you?
"Japanese, of course... (Speaking Japanese)"
Spanish...Cmo ests?
Morocco... (Speaking arabic)
Russian... (Speaking Russian)
Unh! What--what happened?
Now I'm mixed up.
Previously on <i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>
"Mom, dad!"
What brings you out to Hong Kong?
Oh!
Jade: Jackie?
I'm at the airport!
Shendu's flying to Australia!
"The book of ages,"
where all history's
magically recorded!
Jade: Are you telling me shendu rules the world?
Each of the 8 emperors has his or her own domain!
"When shendu wrote in it,"
he must have rewrote the past!
(Gasps)
I'm in demon world!
Why don't I remember any of it?
"This is from the book,"
and it's about me.
"It didn't get rewritten,"
so neither did I!
"If the book's not here in shendu's library,"
there's only one other place it could be.
Australia.
This will let us grab the 12 talismans
that give shendu his magical powers.
Chan!
(Roars)
Jackie!
(Roars)
Huh? - Huh?
How can it be?
Huh?
My talisman!
"I'm sorry, I'll give it back, thank you!"
Uhh! Oh!
Ohh!
How did I do that?
And why do you not catch fire?
"Dog makes you immortal,"
ox makes you super strong.
What else we got?
"Speedy rabbit,"
"levitating rooster,"
"invisible snake,"
and explosive dragon.
Ooh! Good ones!
Ohh!
Grr!
Maybe we better not try for the other half dozen.
Grab the supplies!
Forbidden magic's gonna be hard to come by
out there in demon world.
Tear them apart!
Grr!
Uh-oh.
Levitation plus speed equals flight.
Huh? - Huh?
Whoa! - Whoa!
Stop them!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh! Dead end!
Dragon blast.
We'll outrun 'em...
By a hare.
Aah! - Aah!
Centuries of history altered.
Your very memory erased.
"And still, somehow, you defy me."
"I shall find you, chan,"
"and I promise you,"
I shall erase more than your memory.
"Jade was right, uncle!"
I <i> am</i> a hero.
"We can infiltrate the fortress,"
"find the book of ages,"
and correct history!
Ow!
There is a big army of ninjas
at the fortress in no man's land!
No magic trinkets will help us because
we will be outnumbered!
Uncle's right.
He is?
"If we're gonna pull this off,"
we're gonna need more muscle.
We're gonna need...
The j-team!
Ooh? Huh?
I see no one here I would choose as my apprentice.
"Well, look again."
Uhh! Uhh!
He's...Big.
(Thundering footsteps)
(Uncle gasps)
But po Kong...Is <i> bigger!</i>
Unh!
We must be in her domain.
Looks like shendu's keeping all his enemies
under demon watch.
"More salt for my meal,"
or I shall... Devour you all!
Our hero cannot stop a demon that size!
You're right. You do it.
(Gasps)
M-m-m-me?
"There's only one surefire way to stop a demon,"
and that's to show 'em the door.
Mmm!
Huh?
Chan?
"Page 94, follow the instructions!"
You run interference!
Bwaa!
Jackie! Leap and kick!
Leap and kick!
"Uhh! Oh, gee!"
(Groans)
Aah!
Bwaa!
Ohh!
Oooh.
"Uncle, hurry!"
I do not have the symbol
of the immortal who defeated her!
"Fire was sword, water was gourd, sky was flute..."
Bwoh!
Mmm!
You are going to be scrumptious!
"Earth was flower, wind was fan, mountain was..."
Drum!
Tohru!
You--you know my name?
Talk later. Bang the drum 3 times.
"(Coughing, sputtering)"
(Chanting)
Aah! Ah!
No!
Bwaa!
"Oh, ohh."
That was a very good spell.
(Cheering and laughing)
(Both grunting)
"No mercy, gladiators!"
Battle to the finish!
(Both grunting)
El toro will win. El toro is the greatest!
(Uncle chanting)
Waaa!
Huh?
Fancy fan-work courtesy of paco--
El toro's biggest fan!
Finally we can remove these ridiculous masks.
El toro fuerte <i> never</i> removes his mask.
What?
No music while I bathe?
"Sing for me, my little caged songbird!"
"Tweet, tweet."
"(Uncle chants, flute plays)"
What? Who's playing the flute?
I despise the flute!
(Uncle chanting)
No! No!
Who <i> are</i> you guys?
"Everybody, - say hello to viper--"
the craftiest member of the j-team.
"""Team,"" huh?"
"It's a wrap. The j-team is reassembled,"
and hsi wu's singing career is down the drain.
(Thunder rumbles)
"Uh, guess you didn't know hsi wu was scrubbing up"
'cause he was expecting company.
The thunder demon!
Jackie: Ah! Watch out!
(All yelling)
Aah! Oh!
(Grunting)
Heh. Time flies when you're having fun.
"Viper: Give me your hand, sweetie."
(Grunts)
(Growling)
(Grunting)
"Leap and kick, leap and kick, leap and kick."
"Go, Jackie."
"Your mouse man is good, Jade,"
but El toro is the best!
"No time for that now, paco."
"How's that portal spell coming, uncle?"
You did not mention that the thunder demon
would be in this domain!
We do not have the symbol of the immortal
who originally defeated him!
(Sigh) And it's not like
we can pull castanets out of thin air.
Castanets?
"I prefer the maracas,"
but they are too large for my pockets.
(Grunts) Ohh!
Sorry.
(Uncle chanting)
(Clicking)
(Grunts) No!
What are we waiting for? To the book of ages!
Chan!
So he <i> is</i> behind this!
And things were going <i> so</i> well.
"We were even almost beginning to like you, brother."
(Sputters) What do you mean?
I was just coming to visit...
Hsi wu?
He has been banished to the netherworld!
Technology?
The child!
She somehow escaped
the historical alterations.
And if she knows the history that was...
Then chan now knows of the book.
"What's up, Mr. pouty snout?"
(Sighs)
I do not belong with these heroes.
The ox made me strong.
"Without it, I'm--"
hello? The talismans never made Jackie chan a hero.
You didn't even <i> like</i> to use 'em.
"Courage, brains, and heart are your secret weapons,"
and you've already got those.
All you need is proper training.
"Jackie, I can teach you what you taught me."
You game?
Game.
Cool! First lesson--
the ancient art of butt whoop
starts with breathing.
"The breath flows to the fingertips,"
then down to the toes.
Jade: The book lies behind those walls.
"Ready, team?"
Let's make history.
There is no way in.
Both: T'ch!
Guys in pajamas.
They don't look so tough.
I <i> am</i> good at this.
Duh.
"The mouse man is not bad, but--"
don't start.
(Grunts)
Haagh!
(Grunts)
Uhh!
(Whistles)
And they didn't even use the talismans.
(Rumbling)
Quick! The spells!
What spells?
(Demonic laughter)
(Demonic laughter)
(Demons roar)
Quickly! Locate the book of ages!
We better split up.
Bai tza: Destroy them!
(Roars)
(Growls)
Shendu and his accursed talismans.
(Grunts)
(Gasps)
You're not the only girl with tricks up her sleeve.
(Shrieks)
(Snarls)
But you are the only one who can do that.
Behold my mastery of gravity!
Unhh!
(Grunts)
"Behold my mastery of, uh, <i> pollo.</i>"
(Both grunting)
"Jackie, help uncle search!"
Stop fooling!
Fooling?
I'm not immortal!
Pff! Excuses!
Gaah!
Bingo!
There it is.
The book of ages?
Locate the page shendu altered
so that we may change it back.
No problem.
Look for a page with a missing corner.
(Gasps) Unhh.
(Sinister hiss)
Whoa!
(Grunts)
(Groans)
(Grunting)
"T'ch. There's, like, 5 million pages here!"
Shendu: Get away from that book!
(Groans)
Surrender.
Your team has been neutralized.
Big whoop.
"If I can't find shendu's changes,"
I'll make some of my own.
"""And then Jackie grew 20 feet tall."""
(Growls) - (Gasps)
Heeyah!
Now Jackie <i>is</i> the greatest!
You!
Jackie: Shendu!
The girl!
"""Here comes..."
"Super tohru!"""
(Growls) Huh?
(Grunts)
"""Say hello... To robo-viper."""
Like nuking fish
in a barrel.
(Shrieks)
My turn!
"Hey, no fair!"
Now El toro is the greatest!
Jackie is!
El toro. - Jackie. - El toro.
El toro. - Jackie.
You want to defeat the demons? Yes?
Then write that uncle banishes the demons already!
Duh! - Duh!
(Chanting)
Bad day...
For demons.
Demons: No!
"I will have my revenge, chan!"
Yes! Ha ha! We did it!
Hotcha!
I have found the page!
"Uh, this means you can change us back,"
"right, uncle?"
Once we make changes
to shendu's changes.
"Ooh, here!"
Don't want to lose my place in history.
Jade! - Jade!
Mom! Dad!
Cousin Jackie!
Uncle!
What brings you to Hong Kong?
Tohru: Hong Kong moose world.
"Uh, look at the watch Jackie got me!"
Paco: Moose world?
"Can I go, too?"
What mooses? We were fighting demo--unhh!
"Uh, traffic!"
We were fighting Hong Kong traffic to visit you.
So I could show you how much I've learned in America.
We know you have been doing
"very well there, Jade."
No doubt due to cousin Jackie's
excellent training.
"In all honesty,"
it is Jade who sometimes trains me.
"Hey, Jackie!"
What kinds of martial arts do you know?
"So many, so many style"
you talking of martial arts--a thousand.
"Most important, whatever you learn,"
"it doesn't matter karate, hapkido--whatever."
But everybody has the same goal--
it's discipline.
"It's not fighting, remember."
Tea.
It is about time!
Oh!
"Hey, tohru,"
the Japanese cultural expo starts tomorrow.
"Wall-to-wall music, food, and the coolest techno gear."
(Groans)
"Uh, something the matter?"
Uncle: Forgetting tea is what is the matter!
This is a pot of water.
"Oh, sorry."
You've been acting all weird lately.
"Come on, you can tell me."
"It's uncle, right? That garlic smell?"
It's my mother.
"What, is she sick or-- you have a mom?"
She is arriving from Japan
to attend the expo.
She is a big fan of kare noke
and her yodeling kabukis.
The screechy country singer? Yuck!
But what's so yuck about a visit from your mom?
(Groans)
I am the black sheep.
All I've ever wanted
was for my mother to be proud of me.
"Well, she will be. Look at you."
You're handsome and...
Big.
"You've got, uh... You're big."
You do not understand.
My mother is very hard to please.
Tea.
Thank you.

(Gasps)
Mommy.
Mommy? - Mommy?
This where you live?
(Groans)
You gave up good job
with nice Mr. valmont for this?
Nice?
Hello? Doesn't she know valmont's a crook?
"No, and please do not tell her."
My son...
A servant in a junk shop!
Junk shop?
This is an antique store.
Huh! Only antique I see is the Billy goat there.
Billy goat!
Mommy. Hush up!
Dragon lady should watch her forked tongue
unless she wants a piece of uncle.
Huh! I would sweep floor with you.
And this floor needs it.
Ugh.
Evil eye cannot work on me.
Huh! What junk seller know about work?
"Please, both of you."
Tohru's mother has jet lag
from her long flight.
My uncle is stressed
from working all night on translations.
(Telephone rings)
Phone call.
Hello?
Hope I didn't catch you
"in the middle of anything, Jackie."
"Uh, uncle and tohru's mom are getting acquainted."
Ah. Family time.
Mom: Cheap junk.
Tsing dynasty.
Black: Could be trouble brewing on the horizon.
Oh!
"Believe me, I know."
The octopus will be on exhibit at the Japanese expo.
I'd feel better if you were there
to assist with security.
"Uh, you want me to guard a fish?"
"Actually, octopuses aren't fish. They're multipods."
Octopi.
Please behave!
Sorry.
Grammar was never my best subject in school.
"Oh, you mean the Kyoto octopus."
It is the most famous relic
of the komodo dynasty.
Intelligence sources indicate
that the yokanawa crime family
has the octopus in its sights.
Huh! Why don't you get some light in here?
Thought bats could see in the dark.
This must stop!
My thinking exactly.
I'll set it up.
"Thanks for you help, Jackie."
Huh?
Ugh. Dragon lady waste of my energy.
Must get back to work.
Fine!
"Show me my room, tohru."
Uncle: No room here!
"What do you think, this is a hotel?"
Only for roaches.
"Your hotel, mommy."
"A boy your age, doesn't even own a car."
Makes his mother walk in a typhoon!
Oh.
Does it have fish?
This is a Sushi restaurant.
Everything has fish.
I hate fish.
"Miso soup. Uh, small."
"Hey, isn't that the mountain"
that does the knuckle crunching for valmont?
Not anymore.
Ain't you heard? He's gone straight.
"The bigger they are, the faster they go soft."
Ha ha! Looks like a real mama's boy.
Your soup.
(Slurps)
(Panting)
Can I offer you a ride?
I will walk.
"Come on, tohru."
"It is tohru, isn't it?"
I'll drop you anywhere you say.
Oh.
"Boss: Plush, right?"
This baby's outfitted with the works.
"Fridge, computer..."
Tohru: Soda?
May I have the grape?
Sure. Whatever you like.
Ahh.
Grape is my favorite.
That's 'cause you got good taste.
"So, uh, tohru,"
I got a proposition for you.
"No, thank you."
Just hear me out.
This isn't just some 2-bit heist.
What I've got in mind has 8 legs
and is loaded with jewels.
You will kidnap kare noke
and her yodeling kabukis?
Kare noke and her--ha ha ha!
I love this guy!
"No, my friend."
I'm talking about the Kyoto octopus.
I don't think so.
"Hey, for old time's sake. Serious payday."
Could buy yourself a car just like this one.
Make your mom proud.
"Must call landlord,"
tell him to spray for vermin.
"Button your lip, windbag."
I am here to see my boy.
Tohru is out. Where?
Do not know.
Huh! Lousy boss.
Can't keep track of own employees.
That's not fair.
"Uncle's a great boss,"
and tohru loves it here.
"You are a sweet girl,"
very cute.
But please do not speak of matters
"beyond your understanding, child."
Should have seen tohru
when he worked for Mr. valmont.
Had his own room.
Big!
Always a spare bed for his mother.
Valmont? Ah. Valmont was a--
uncle!
"Uh, heh. Ix-nay on the almont-vay."
"Ah, child speaks many languages."
And look at you!
Cannot even speak English!
Speak English better than you!
"Do not! Do, too!"
"In your dreams, junk monger!"
Eyah!
Hyah! Kak-kak-kyah!
Oh.
Mom: Gave up good job with nice Mr. valmont for this?
Servant in a junk shop!
Boss: Kyoto octopus.
Black: Serious payday.
Boss: Buy yourself a car just like this one.
Tohru: Grape.
Uncle: Cheap?! I am not cheap!
Ha! I see the rags tohru wears.
Same clothes as when he worked for valmont.
Jackie: Ah! I have no time
to play referee for the both of you.
Must get over to the expo.
Play security guard for an octopus.
"Boss: You made a wise choice, tohru."
What do I do?
Nothing fancy.
"You cruise into the expo,"
create a diversion.
"Meanwhile, my boys make an end run,"
nab the octopus.
"One tiny problem, tohru."
"Word is, you double-crossed"
your old boss valmont.
That you're a rat.
I am no rat.
Yeah? Prove it!
I have information.
Yeah?
"Um, Jackie chan will be working security at the expo."
I heard of him.
They say he's unbeatable.
Nobody is unbeatable.
I trust you'll take care
"of this Jackie chan personally, tohru."
And I mean permanently.
(Chatter)
Whoa!
"Jade, how did you get in here?"
Security's lousy.
You have to leave. Things could get ugly.
Go! Go! Go!
Not on my salary.
Aah!
Wha...?
A little backup!
Tohru?
Whah!
I knew we couldn't trust this guy!
Whoa! Unh.
Whoa.
Octo-jacking in progress.
Ow!
Banzai!
"Thank you for the tip-off, tohru."
Of course.
Your mom will be very proud.
Tohru has a mom?
(Gasps)
The octopus!
And this one's not just a smokescreen!
(Both groaning)
(Tohru grunting)
Oh.
Oh!
Jackie and tohru! Where?
"Uh, here's the deal:"
"You give us the octopus,"
or your boys do a meet-and-greet
with a shark.
Market street Sushi bar. One hour.
"Come through the front door,"
and come alone.
Well?
No problem.
Trade octopus for young ones.
"Wait, one problem."
What?
I have no octopus.
Jade: You do now.
"Pretty good for a child, huh?"
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Tohru and Jackie need us.
"Us, not you."
"Me, not us."
Youngster-nappers say come alone.
Ha! Foolish old junk monger
cannot handle this alone.
"Uh, why don't I just--"
no! - No! Hmmph.
I will phone captain black.
"In the meantime,"
stay here and watch the shop.
"Watch the shop, huh?"
Well...
Watched it.
Nobody double-crosses
"the yokanawa mob, tohru."
"You just made the biggest,"
"dumbest, and last mistake"
of your life.
"But you have a deal, right?"
"Once you get the octopus, you set us free."
"Ha ha! Once we get the octopus,"
you and your chum are gonna <i> be</i> chum.
Fish bait.
I do not like fish.
"Hey, check this out, boys."
Walkin' the dog.
Wha...? - Hey!
Uncle! Mommy!
"Hey, I said front door"
and to come alone!
I told her.
"See, I told you!"
Ah! Would have lost your way!
Near-sighted mule
can barely see hook nose
in front of his face.
Eyesight good enough to see the hair
growing out of that mole!
That is a beauty mark!
"Quit the squabblin',"
and put the fish on the table.
"Uh, boss?"
"Technically,"
an octopus is a member
"of the multipod family, and--"
put the fish on the table!
"Uncle, don't!"
"Jackie, be quiet!"
There. Now we all go home.
What say we make it a family affair?
Throw 'em all in the tank!
Eyee! Yak-kak-kah!
Whoa. Nice move.
"You watching, junk man?"
"Watching, but seeing nothing special."
Hand is quicker than the eye.
Hyah!
Unh.
But should have been watching the foot.
Unh.
"Ah, get this over with."
I came a long way to hear kare noke sing.
Ha! You call that singing?
(Sings out of tune)
Tone-deaf owl
is cruising for a bruising!
Another trick I've been working on.
Oh.
Jackie! Tohru!
"Jade, what are you doing here?"
"Oh, never mind. Give us a hand!"
"Oh, no, you don't!"
Whoa!
Unh.
Whoa!
Tohru: Oh!
(Both gurgling)
Aah!
(Jade struggling)
Jade!
I'm ok.
Mommy?
Uncle?
<i>No Ms.</i>
(Gasps)
Where is the octopus?
Mr. yo-yo mob took it.
"Well, I'm sure he's miles away by now."
Wha...?
Hey!
Unh.
My favorite trick-- around the world.
"Nice work, Jackie."
I am very sorry
"for the unpleasantness, mommy."
My brave little boy.
You make your mother proud.
I am glad that you are not hurt.
And also glad you are with people
who care about you.
"Jackie, Jade, the Billy goat."
Hmmph.
I will show you a Billy goat!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ayee-yak-yak-yah!
"Whoa. Oh, no! Stop it, both of you!"
Looks like the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.
"Uh, want to go back to the Japanese expo?"
I have heard kare noke and her yodeling kabukis
put on a very good show.
Jackie: Uncle! Tohru's mommy! Mom: Eyaah-kak-kak-kah!
Don't! Oh!
Uncle: Hyah! Eeyah!
"Man: Hey, Jackie,"
what's your favorite kind of music?
"I like rock songs because it makes me,"
"like, uh, when I'm training,"
I like this kind of music.
"Celine Dion,"
"Mariah Carey,"
Whitney Houston.
I really can hear what is she saying.
Then I can practice my English.
So many...
"Bee gees, carpenter,"
abba. Beatles? No.
I'm too young.
"Jackie: And 3 days ago,"
Paul connell notified the museum
that he had made a major discovery.
"Yeah, well, I made a major discovery, too."
You can get frostbite on your butt.
Mr. connell described his find as
a prehistoric humanoid frozen in the ice.
Whoa! A caveman!
That was the last the museum heard from him.
I suspect - that connell and his inuit laborers got--
eaten?
Frightened.
That would explain why there was nobody
at the research lab when we arrived there.
This place could creep anyone out.
We must enter the cave with--
flashlights!
Respect.
Jade: Whoa.
(Gasps)
"Yes, whoa."
We must bring it back
to the lab for study.
Look at his expression.
I wonder what was going through his mind.
(Gasps)
Look out behind you.
"Yes, perhaps."
"No. I mean, look out behind you."
(All grunting)
(All grunting)
"Please, we mean you no harm."
I am an archeologist.
This creature is an important scientific discovery.
I'm only taking him to our lab
"for further study, ok?"
(Man grunts)
You have disturbed that which should not be disturbed.
"Jade, get on the sled."
Ahh. Are those boots elk skin?
Moose.
(Grunts)
Oh.
Sorry.
Jade: Jackie!
Good dogs! Mush!
(Grunts)
Whoa!
"Pretty good save, huh?"
"Yes, but Jade,"
could you--
just wait till tohru and uncle
get a load of ice guy.
They're gonna freak!
Jade!
What did you say?
Uh-oh.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
"Bad day, bad day!"
Oh...
Save number 2. I rule.
"Yes. - And from now on,"
I drive.
"Oh. Jackie, why you turn temperature down?"
You want us to wind up like him?
It is important to keep the specimen frozen
for preservation purposes.
"Sorry, old timer."
Guess it's another cold night for you.
I found something!
It is some sort of tribal artifact.
There are markings.
"That your I.D. Bracelet, big fella?"
Hmm...
Ancient inuit hieroglyphics.
"What does it mean, uncle? Ow!"
It means quiet!
I must study.
(Snoring)
I believe little man symbol represents day.
Bird represents life.
Huh...
Translation difficult under these conditions.
(Yawns) Without sleep.
Without tea!
And this is a tree.
"They had those back in your day, too."
Just not locally.
And these are snow tires.
(Yawns)
"Jade, why are you still awake?"
Because I'm not sleeping?
(Yawns)
Finish translations in morning.
Good idea. Jade?
Soon.
Gonna show him some ads for snowboarding equipment
"so what is this, ice guy?"
Your grocery list or something?
Hmm...
"Ok, so here's what I got."
"""When cold turns to heat,"
"""uh, something will arise."
"""When night turns to day,"
"blah, blah, will run free."""
(Sighs)
"Ok, I give up. What's it mean?"
(Gasps)
Did you just...
Are you...
(Snoring)
Oh...
Huh?
90 degrees?
Uncle!
Aah! Huh.
Feels like we are back in San Francisco.
Why did you adjust the thermostat?
I did no such thing.
"Tohru, did you turn up the heat?"
Heat? What heat?
(Gasps)
The specimen!
Ice man has risen!
Bad omen.
Frozen prehistoric creatures do not just walk away.
I suspect someone broke in and--
(loud grunt)
Aye-yah!
Jade!
(Gasps)
I do not believe it.
Me neither.
"Jade, you found cereal."
"Sorry, all gone."
Guess a couple of thousand years in the deep freeze
will give a guy an appetite.
(Burps)
"Jade, what have you done?"
Defrosted him.
"Didn't I, Duane?"
Duane?
Named him after a friend's dad.
"He's got this real hairy back, and--"
"Jade,"
"this is not a cute, furry animal."
This prehistoric pre-humanoid
could be very dangerous.
"Come on, Jackie."
Duane is totally mellow.
(Burps)
"Ok, so he could use come table manners,"
but that's where I come in.
I can teach him all kinds of stuff.
"Wait till I show you TV, Duane."
Cable toon channel's gonna blow your mind!
You will not show him anything.
He does not belong here.
He should be...
On ice!
(Grunts)
(Screaming)
(Growls)
"Nice going, uncle Jackie."
You hurt his feelings.
We gotta find Duane.
He's been out of circulation
for a couple thousand years.
He could get lost or hurt.
Or hurt someone else.
There he is!
Strange.
The inuit is using fish to lure the ice man.
"Duane likes fish, remember?"
It's tohru who hates fish.
But the inuits seem terrified of the creature.
Why would they--
(engine roaring)
(Gasps)
Both: Avalanche!
Aah!
Both: Aah!
(Grunts)
(Gasps)
(Whistles)
(Both grunting)
Good dogs! Mush!
(Craaaash)
(Avalanche stops)
Both: Whew!
Ahh...
You really are man's best friend.
"That was... Kind of cool,"
"except for, you know,"
the part about almost getting crushed.
I suspect the avalanche was no accident.
There was a snowmobile atop the glacier.
(Gasps) Someone is coming!
Uncle?
What are you doing here?
Ice fishing.
Uncle finish translation.
Tell story of ice man.
One more thing--
he's not dangerous.
Told you.
"Maybe the ice creature is not dangerous,"
but whoever kidnapped him is.
"Come, uncle. I may need you."
Oh...
Uncle never gets to do what he wants.
(Indistinct murmuring)
No sign of our caveman.
"Hey, there's the guy who tried to shishkabob us."
Bet you he's got Duane locked up in his tent.
I will sneak around the back.
You 2 wait here.
(Scoffs)
"Jackie gets to go to a nice, warm tent."
Leaves us here to freeze.
Always thinking of himself.
Come.
Need to work on your sneaking around.
Inuits can hear footsteps in snow
a mile away.
That so?
"Uncle, Jade!"
I told you to--
we are not armed...
But that doesn't mean
we won't go polar on your butt
if you don't hand over Duane.
"Jade, please."
She means the prehistoric cave creature.
No such creature here.
"Oh, so maybe your sister has big feet?"
My sister has tiny feet.
She is delicate like a bird.
Come inside.
Ancient legend tells of an evil snow spirit
who many moons past rained ice upon the world.
Would have frozen the whole planet
if inuit ancestors had not defeated him.
And that's what you think the creature we excavated is?
"A ""snow spirit?"""
Mmm...
Must be returned to the ice cave
before he destroys the world.
But Duane isn't an evil spirit.
He's sweet. He eats cereal.
Child speaks truth.
Ice man not evil.
Not even a spirit.
I am not familiar with this legend.
Where did you hear of it?
From the great shaman.
"Only last week, he foretold"
the evil spirit's return.
Bah...Shaman.
You are superstitious old fool.
Takes one to know one.
Everything you say like glue--
sticks back to you.
That does not even make sense.
"Both of you, please stop fighting."
Bah...
Artifact tells of how ice man was trapped and frozen in cave.
Ancient inuits tried to free him.
"Could not, but foretold the day"
he would once again run free across tundra.
"There you go. If he was an evil spirit,"
why would they try to set him free?
Hmm...
You make a good point.
But the great shaman says different.
"Says it is an evil spirit,"
and must be destroyed.
Where is this shaman?
Duane!
He's no shaman.
"That is Peter Bailey,"
a black marketeer.
He steal artifacts and sells them to the highest bidder.
But the shaman has great powers.
He can speak to other shamans
across the sea through a magical black box.
You mean like this?
It's called a cell phone. Hello?
Everybody's got one back where we come from...
Except for me.
(Ringing)
Uncle: Uncle's antique. Not here. Call back.
Hey!
Stop!
Many moons have passed.
Must return evil spirit creature to ice.
You lie.
The ice man is harmless.
You believe them?
These are evil ones who set evil spirit free.
That's just some phony baloney legend you made up.
Maybe you want to show me the trick
with the cell phone again.
"He's got your number, Bailey. Face!"
"You want to talk numbers, girly?"
That hairy missing link's worth 10 times
more than that junk I came here for.
"He's a living creature, not some...Beanie."
You can't sell Duane.
"Ha! Try and stop me, mates."
"Uncle, watch Jade!"
Jade?
Mush!
You fish?
What do you think?
I go to a drive-thru burger place?
Ha ha! 6 dogs versus a hundred horsepower?
"Don't think so, pally."
Baah!
(Sighs)
Need less weight.
(Grunting)
"Uh, hi."
What are you doing here?
Duane's my friend.
I thawed him out and fed him and--
too dangerous. Stay with tohru.
I found moose jerky.
Go! Go!
(Laughing)
Aah!
Go! Go!
"Get along, little doggies!"
Ahh.
(Grunts)
(Grunts)
Whoa! Oof.
Everyone ok?
Aah!
Aah!
Oof!
You're about to join
"the polar Bear club, pally, but hey,"
look at the bright side.
Maybe someone will dig <i> you</i> up
in about a thousand years.
(Roaring)
"Get back, you hairy beast!"
I'm warning you!
(Growls)
Whaah!
"No, please, help me!"
I hear ice fishing is very good
this time of year.
"Don't worry, you're drifting east."
Should reach solid ground in 2 days.
"Hold tight, Jackie,"
'cause it's Jade of the north coming in
for one more save.
Too late.
I was already assisted by...
A friend.
Let's get this gentleman onto the sled.
Then we'll head to the airport.
You want to take Duane home with us?
He will be safe at section 13--
"placed under observation, studied,"
fed cereal.
Hello.
King Kong? Mighty Joe young?
We can't take Duane back to civilization.
But I thought he was your friend.
"He is, and that's why we got to leave him..."
Here.
Ahh...
The Aurora borealis.
Northern lights.
The inscription!
"""When night turns to day,"
"something--something will run free."""
"I expect you are correct, Jade."
And also correct about Duane staying here
in his natural habitat.
"Go ahead, big guy."
Run. Be free.
Where is sensei?
(Gasps)
Uncle!
"By now, probably at war"
with the inuit elder.
Huh...My secret.
"Anchovy, eh?"
Baah! Catch nothing but minnows.
"What do you fish with, worms?"
Mung beans wrapped in tea leaves.
Fish take a number to get on hook.
Ahh...
"Big talk, no action."
"Ahh, see?"
I got something.
(Grunting)
(Grunting)
So does uncle.
Big something!
Ha! See?
My bait gone. Yours still on hook.
So what?
"So, fish we lost was mine!"
"No, that was my fish."
My fish!
You're a liar!
My fish!
You cheated.
"Hey, Jackie?"
Do you miss your family
when you're off making movies?
"My business is, uh, very, very difficult,"
because I'm so busy.
"A location scout, training, rehearsal."
The camera rolling.
"The only things I know is comedy, action."
"Great stunts, great action."
"Sometimes when I'm off camera,"
take a break...
Then I do miss my family.
"But what can I do? Travel, travel, travel, travel."
Jackie: Ahem. Uh...
I am here to see Mr. jambah.
The curator?
He asked if I would pick up some photos
to deliver to a colleague of his
at the archeology conference in Calcutta.
Eh...Which I will be flying to in 2 hours.
"If you could call him, please, for--"
(snores)
The museum directors must feel very secure
knowing you are on the job.
Mr. jambah?
Hello?
Man: You know why we have come.
Where are the sutras of rachtajhiba?
Man: Tell your master I know nothing about them.
You speak lies!
"Jackie, help! Thieves!"
"Stop! Stay where you are,"
nobody gets hurt.
This does not concern you. Leave here!
Mr. jambah is a respected colleague.
You leave!
"Oh, you are yoga masters."
Nonviolent.
But I thought yoga was to promote peace within.
Ooh...
I am still standing.
Oh...Oh!
Ahh.
Jackie! - Oh!
"Jackie, a thousand apologies."
It's ok. I am fine.
Ow...Ooh.
"Oh, I've done you a terrible wrong."
You are hurt.
Those men. Who were they?
Thieves. Very bad men.
They mentioned the sutras of rachta...
"Rachtajhiba,"
an ancient evil text
said to possess great destructive power.
To think I would even permit such an unpleasant artifact
to be included in my collection is beyond ridiculous.
"And impossible, because you see,"
the sutras of rachtajhiba are mere legend.
Oh. Perhaps we should get you some medical attention.
No. I'm fine. Really.
(Moans) Oh...Oh...
The photos you wanted me to bring to India?
"Oh, yes! My colleague from the British museum"
will be meeting you at the conference.
You are very kind to do this for me.
It is my--ah! Pain.
"Oh, you are coming with me to see my dentist Dr. Webber."
He is very gentle.
Thank you.
"Flying is disagreeable enough,"
even without having to suffer a painful mouth.
Man: Where are the sutras?
"Mohajah, I--"
(man thinking) We have disappointed our master.
We are not worthy.
You return empty-handed?
"But, mohajah, we were outnumbered."
Concentrate. Mustn't allow mohajah to read my mind
or he will know we were defeated by--
tell me of this one man
who bested 3 disciples.
"Well, I'm afraid you're going to need"
"a complete jaw transplant, Mr. chan."
Huh?!
Ha ha ha! Just kidding!
You simply have a displaced filling.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.
"Elisa, prepare a shot of novocaine, please."
Uh...I don't like needles.
Oh...Well...
I could drill without numbing you.
"(Gulps) Ok. Numbing, please."
Ha ha ha.
One new filling coming right up.
If jambah or one of his accomplices
"is to return to India with the sutras,"
he must pass through here.
"(Muffled speech) Good-bye, uncle."
We'll be back on thurday.
I cannot understand a word you are saying.
His mouth's still numb from the dentist.
"He said if the school sends over any homework, it's a mistake."
Just toss it.
No! I did-ent. I thaid--
"no, no, don't talk! Listen!"
Make sure not to forget to pick up spices
for uncle in Calcutta.
"Yeth, uncle."
Curry powder.
I wrote ID down. Thee?
That is the man from the museum--
jambah's colleague.
(Beeping)
(Beep beep beep)
"Oh, ah got a new fillin' today."
Shee?
"I must move closer,"
read his mind.
"Here's your ticket, Jade."
It's so cool you're taking me along
"on this once-in-a-lifetime educational experience, uncle Jackie."
(Thinking) Three whole days-- no school! Yes!
"Ah mith you, uncle."
"(Thinking) I'll miss you, uncle."
An' don' worry... I won' forget da curry powder.
You are a good nephew.
(Thinking) Ah! Jackie will forget!
He always forgets!
There are too many minds here.
(Gasps)
The sutras of rachtajhiba--
I know you have them.
"Well, actually, <i> had.</i>"
Jackie chan?!
Stop him!
"Ah, I can - speak clearly again."
Great. Now you can chitchat with the eggheads.
"Oh, first things first."
I am starving.
"No, duh. You dribbled everything you tried to eat on the plane."
Ow!
"Oh, sorry."
I just had some dental work done.
I am - so not with him.
Pardon me.
Would you be Mr. Jackie chan?
"Oh, I would...Anytime."
"I mean, yes."
"Hmm. Portia martindale, British museum."
And you have something I want.
I do?
The photographs from Mr. jambah.
Oh. Oh! Yes.
The light is so much better out on the balcony.
Care to join me?
Ok.
"Go, Jackie!"
"Mr. chan, may I just say--"
"oh, please. Call me Jackie."
"Jackie, I was so impressed"
when I read how you discovered
that lost city in patagonia.
"Oh, thank you."
I was very lucky. I had a very good map.
"Mmm, and he's humble, too."
"Oh, so clumsy!"
"Oh, please. Allow me."
There is the signal.
"Thank you, Jackie."
"You know, it's so very nice out,"
I feel like a walk. How about you?
"Oh, that would be--"
(woman screaming)
Nice to meet you. Good-bye. Thank you.
"Excuse me. Oh, sorry."
Pardon me.
"Jade, return to the hotel room!"
"Didn't say ""please."""
Sorry! I'll bring it back! Thank you!
"Got him - in my sights, gentlemen."
Why do you keep chasing me?
Oh!
Aah! Oof!
"Hey, you! Pay first!"
"Whoa! Dumbo, heel! Please!"
"He's traveling by elephant,"
the bazaar in the medan.
(Screaming)
Oh! Ow!
My tooth! No shock absorbers!
Yeow! Oof!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Ah, Jackie, do not forget curry powder."
"Ok, uncle. I took care of it."
Have to go. Bye.
Sorry about your shop. Send me your bill. Thank you!
(Groans)
(Grunts)
Huh?
Jambah?
Miss martindale!
Dr. weber? I don't understand.
"Oh, you will in a moment."
A little novocaine to ease the pain?
"Oh, don't bother, portia."
Mr. chan hates needles. Ha ha ha.
No. Please!
Don't!
"There now. That wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Yes, it was."
"I suppose we owe you an explanation, Jackie."
"You heard of the sutras of rachtajhiba, yes?"
Only at your museum.
You said they were just a legend.
I lied.
"You see, the sutras do very much exist."
In my filling!
"Magnificent, are they not?"
"A 3,000-word incantation painstakingly inscribed"
by skilled sorcerers onto a piece of silver
no larger than a grain of basmati rice.
"Legend foretells that when the sutras are returned to the Ganges,"
the river will dry up.
"Oh, that would be--"
so those thieves who have been after me--
you have been trying to stop them!
Well...No.
"Actually, they've been trying to stop us."
"They are not truly thieves, you see."
They are disciples of mohajah.
"Who? Oh, a do-gooder mystic--"
a psychic.
Claims his mission is to protect India from evil magic.
Mohajah suspected I was in possession of the sutras
and was planning to transport them here to India.
But none of us could carry the sutras without the mohajah knowing it.
That mind-reading power of his--oh!
Real nuisance.
So you had to find a courier
who did not know he was carrying the sutras.
Me.
"We do so appreciate your help, Jackie."
But that means you want to dry up the Ganges river. Why?!
"Have you no sense of vision, man?"
Do you not realize what treasures lie on the riverbed?
"Centuries worth of artifacts, silver, gold,"
riches beyond measure there for the taking!
But millions of people depend upon the river
for farming and travel and--
(gasps) Lives will be destroyed!
"Oh, Jackie's a bit of a sentimentalist."
"So sweet, but, really,"
one must have priorities.
We're talking about the archeological event of the millennium.
"If a few people must be inconvenienced,"
(hums)
You are bad people-- all of you!
"Ah, yes. Soon to be very rich people."
(Grunts)
"Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt."
Jade?! I told you to go back to the hotel room.
"Lost my key. Ok, now, let the chan man go."
"Dr. weber, give the child a lollipop."
"Don't sucker me, sucker! Hyah!"
"Stand back, or I'll..."
Dribble?
"Jade, the other one!"
Ha! Your plan to destroy a million lives
has gone down the drain.
Yes! The drain...
Which leads to the sewers--
which flow directly into the Ganges river.
Aah! Jade! We have to--
as you were.
Care to tell them what a full-on blast of X-ray radiation
"will do to one's internal organs, Dr. weber?"
"Ha ha ha. Well, those lead aprons we provide our patients"
are not frivolous accessories.
So let's all just sit tight
"and let the sewer do its work, shall we?"
"Uh, Jackie, did you remember to get uncle's curry powder?"
"Yes, Jade, but now is not the time to--"
uncle's curry powder-- yes.
Right...Here!
(Sneezing and coughing)
We must find a way into--there!
Ugh!
Finding a tiny piece of silver in all of this--
this-- - this yuck!
Oh! Follow the current!
What if we stop the current?
(Groans)
"Jade, no!"
Whoa!
Aaah! - Aaah!
(Screaming)
Jade: Look!
(Gasps) The opening to the river!
I only hope we are not too late.
I see it!
Ugh!
Bottle cap. Heh.
Hmm? That chanting...
"It's coming from the sutras,"
as if they sense the river is--
(gasps)
Oh!
Aaah!
Yes!
Jade!
I know. I am good.
Behind you!
The sutras--I will be taking them now.
"You'll have to pry 'em out of my wet, cold, yucky fingers."
Whoa. I <i> am</i> good.
They cannot move.
Mind control.
"The sutras, please."
"Oh, no, you don't!"
"(Grunting) It is all right, Jade."
They are the good guys.
(Whispering) You sure?
He's got this whole Spock mind-meld
scanner thing happening.
"Thank you, Jackie chan."
My disciples and I shall ensure
that the sutras remain safe from those
who would use them for evil.
You are welcome.
Aah! Very bad toothache.
Huh? My toothache-- it's gone.
Power of the mind.
"Hey, uh, think you could do some power of the mind"
to remove the yuck from my shoes?
(Cell phone rings)
My cell phone!
It is your uncle
reminding you to bring home curry powder.
That is...Amazing.
There is one more thing that he desires.
Though I am not quite sure I understand.
Ow!
"Hey, Jackie!"
Yes?
Where do you get the ideas for your stunts?
So many years I've been doing action films
"I really, like, school myself."
"Study every movie, every Bruce Lee film,"
"Stallone film, everybody."
"I've been thinking, punch or kicking all same."
Sometimes just boring.
The props really help me a lot.
"Situation, props, and different country,"
"different culture, different background--"
they all help me.
They all help me to doing a stunt. Yeah.
I cannot believe I am stuck in the jungle
with such a spoiled brat.
You invited me.
I was talking about him.
"Mr. Smith! Please,"
we must stay together.
There are many dangers in the bush.
"Eh, yes, yes, so you keep saying."
"Hop to it, Larsen."
Why don't we ditch frick and frack and have some real fun?
Go swinging with the monkeys
or wrestle a crocodile?
"What do you say, big j?"
"I'm sorry, Jade, but you must learn"
that growing up sometimes means having to do things
that are not fun.
Like guiding obnoxious jerks through the jungle
just 'cause they give lots of money to the museum?
Uh...Yes.
"In that case, - I never want to grow up."
What am I saying?
I can't wait to grow up.
"Get my own car, cell phone--"
"which, now that you mention it..."
I didn't mention it.
"Smith: Oh, Mr. chan..."
(Sighs) Yes?
"Uh, why don't you take a fiver"
while Larsen snaps a few photos?
"Oh. Please, Mr. Smith,"
this is no place to dawdle.
"Well, how do I look, Larsen?"
"Very vibrant, sir."
(Twigs snapping)
(Gasps) Do not move!
Black panther!
Shoo! Shoo-shoo-shoo!
(Growling)
"Uh, Jackie? I think that only works on bears."
Haah!
Nobody move.
Aah! Throw me your camera!
"That is a $4,000 zoltex"
with a hand-ground German lens and--
grrr!
Whew!
"And if you want photographs,"
buy picture postcards at the airport!
I am through warning you
about the dangers of the bush.
"This happens again, we turn back."
"Oh, all right, Mr. chan. You've made your point."
No dawdling.
"Speaking of which, it seems to me"
"that if we continue on this path,"
"it will take 2 days to reach the lost city of the muntabs,"
but only 2 hours if we climb over that mountain.
"If I had a cell phone, we could have called ahead for a weather report."
"According to my map,"
the lost city of the muntabs should be right...
"Well, now we know how the lost city got its name."
This map can't be wrong.
I--I--I paid a fortune for it!
"I warned you when we began the expedition, Mr. Smith."
The map might be a forgery.
There has never been any proof that muntab ruins exist.
"What's so great about these muntabs, anyway?"
Ancient legends speak of the muntabs'
extraordinary health and long life.
Ooh! Just imagine what secrets
their artifacts might reveal.
I suggest we turn back before the storm grows any worse.
I refuse to give up so easily!
I can't. I won't!
Whoa.
(Squeaking)
"Ohh, the muntab cloak of invisibility!"
The what?
Some legends speak of the muntabs' mastery of mirage--
a mixture of science and sorcery
that allowed them to shield their city.
"It's definitely a wall,"
"and if there's a wall,"
there must be a door.
(Gasps)
"I found it, Larsen,"
the lost city of the muntabs.
"Bully for you, sir."
We must proceed with extreme caution.
There is no telling what lies...
Ahead?
It's like something out of a Tarzan movie.
It's fantastic.
"Muntabs, Larsen."
They still exist.
"So it would appear, sir."
"You know, if I had a cell phone,"
we could be calling 911.
Not now.
"Quickly, Larsen. Take a picture."
No! Do not make any sudden moves!
(Murmuring)
"Eh, wait!"
"Uh, please!"
We mean no harm.
"Uh, I am an archaeologist."
"We are just visitors,"
"uh, accidental tourists."
(Murmuring) (Murmuring)
Sorry. I did not want to do that.
"Uh, better come up with some more stuff"
"you don't want to do, quick."
"Huh? What is he, a coward?"
It's called capturing the high ground.
Hello? Martial arts 101?
This is a very bad way to work out disagreements.
How about we sit down and--ooof!
Ohh! (Grunting)
(Grunting)
Jackie!
(Gasps)
Ohhh!
"Please, I don't want to hurt you."
(Growls)
I warned you.
(Crunching)
(Grunts)
You don't know who you're messing with!
"Once my uncle Jackie gets hold of you,"
you're history!
"Jade, please. You will anger them."
"A bit late for that, I dare say."
(Gasps) Their chief!
"Well, talk to him, chan."
You're the expert on aboriginal cultures.
Huh? Uh...
How about that rain?
Outsiders not welcome here.
"Eh, we come in peace."
"In fact, we will happily <i>leave</i> in peace."
Hopefully one piece.
This...Weapon?
"Heh heh. No, no. A ca-me-ra."
Push the button. Go ahead.
(Everyone gasps)
(Muttering)
Light in a box.
(Chief laughing)
(Muntabs laughing)
Oh. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha hee hee!
(All laughter stops)
"(Clears throat) You see, we mean no harm."
Chief: One way to be sure.
A test. Behold cave of truth.
Only pure of spirit may pass through unharmed.
"Well, if you're asking for volunteers..."
Him.
Huh?
"Um, so what happens if he doesn't make it through?"
Then you shall all suffer
a fate far worse than his.
"Uh-huh. Come on, chan!"
Get your game face on! Let's go!
"You can do it, Jackie!"
I know you can!
I'm almost positive you can.
"Uh, just between you and me,"
what are his chances?
Many have entered the cave...
And?
None have emerged.
Ohhh.
(Gasps) A white rhino!
But you are extinct!
Ahh. Another muntab mirage.
Aaaah! Not a mirage!
"Bad day, bad day!"
Sorry. Good rhino.
I don't hear anything.
Is that a good sign?
Aaaaaah!
D-ohhh!
Aaaaaaaah!
Very bad day!
(Rumbling)
Chan!
"Please, Jackie."
His heart was not pure.
You will all pay for your lies.
(Coughing)
You should really reinforce those walls.
Cave is very flimsy.
What'd I tell you? My uncle is pure of heart
and tough as nails.
Ohhh.
(Playing in rhythm)
"Eat, eat."
Thank you. You are very generous.
Generosity not given. It is earned.
"Oh, that's very wise, yes."
"Uh, one would expect a chief of such wisdom"
"to be an old man, but you, uh,"
not a gray hair or a wrinkle.
"In fact, not one of you looks a day over 35."
It is a blessing to have wisdom of age
and body of youth.
"Oh, I couldn't agree more."
"So how do you do it? Uh, diets? Exercise?"
Our ways are muntab ways.
"Oh, come on, chief."
I'm prepared to offer plenty for your secret.
Do you know what this is?
Money. Major <i> dinero.</i>
Hmm. Prefer cloth.
"Huh. Tell you one thing, chan."
"These people may look good,"
but they are backward as all get out.
(Laughter)
"Come, Jade. We play."
Hello.
"Cool, abila. 2 dolls for the price of one."
Want to play with her?
"Uh, thanks, but I'm a little old to be playing with dolls."
Oh--not that there's anything wrong with them.
"I mean, when I was your age--"
"what are you, like, 7, 8?"
Heh. 230.
"(Laughs) Oh, right."
"Jade, I want to show you something,"
but you must promise to keep it a secret.
My nickname? Fort Knox.
"Secrets go in, they don't come out."
"Honored guest, tell me, what brought you here?"
How you find muntabs?
"Mr. Smith purchased this map,"
and we began searching for your ruins.
"Uh, I mean, not ruins. I mean,"
we had no idea that your people still...
"Uh, that you were--"
ah! Entertainment!
"Honored guest, please join fire dance."
"Oh, uh, well, thank you. But I am not much of a dancer."
Not wise to dishonor chief.
This ought to be good.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Honored guest spoke truth.
Not good dancer.
(Gasps)
Chalice of life!
It is gone!
Chalice of life?
Muntab: Chalice!
Second muntab: Where's the chalice?
"Return it, now!"
"Uh, but I did not take your chalice."
See?
Lies!
Hold on!
"Jackie went through that truth tunnel thing, didn't he?"
"So he's pure or something, right?"
The young one is wise.
You betcha.
Smith.
Ugh. We are doomed.
What do you mean?
Chief: Chalice filled with water from altar
gives muntabs eternal life.
Stay young forever.
"So, you weren't kidding. 230?"
I will be 231 next week.
"Uh, happy birthday?"
"Without chalice, we will grow old."
And Smith will be immortal?
"2,000 plus years of obnoxiousness. Yuck!"
Jade! You must gather your warriors!
Smith couldn't have gone far.
We'll stop him!
We already grow weak.
"With no chalice to refresh us,"
we will perish in the jungle.
It is too late.
Too late? Come on! Where's that good old muntab--
"uh, I mean <i> young</i> muntab spirit?"
It's never too late.
"You are so young, yet speak with the wisdom of an elder."
"See, Jackie?"
He won't even let me have my own cell phone.
Ugh! Jade!
(Both panting)
Jackie!
"Everything I've ever hoped for, Larsen,"
"right here, right now."
Eternal youth!
Eternal life!
"Perhaps you would like me to sample it first, sir?"
To make sure it's safe.
"Oh, no, that won't be necessary."
"You don't think I'd leave you out of this,"
"do you, old friend?"
After all your years of faithful service?
"Well, I had hoped--"
"Larsen, I want you by my side"
to serve me forever.
"Oh, goodie."
Shake him off!
Whoa!
Ugh! Gah! Ugh!
Gaah!
Whoa!
"Larsen, cut the ladder!"
"Is that really necessary, sir?"
What harm could he possibly do you now?
Do it!
"Well, don't just sit there, Larsen."
Take the controls!
"You're not stopping me, chan!"
What did you do?!
Parachutes!
"Oh, none for us, thanks."
"You see, Larsen and I are immortal now."
Want it?
"Good-bye, Mr. chan."
Yaaah!
Ow! Unh! Unh!
Ow! Unh! Unh!
Ow! Ooh! Unh!
Ohh!
Guess what I caught?
My camera! Completely ruined!
"Well, that's it, Larsen. I'm docking your wages for 75 years."
"Yes, sir."
(Gasps)
Abila?
Jade.
Thank you for saving my people.
You are brave and generous.
"As a wise, young chief once told me,"
"generosity is not given,"
it is earned.
"Uh, Jackie, that was Smith's map."
Yes. No one will ever find the muntabs again.
Hello? How are we supposed to find our way back through the jungle?
"Well, Larsen..."
How do I look?
"Very youthful, sir."
I think I need to be changed.
"Oh, goodie."
I am sure this is the right way.
You said that 6 hours ago.
"Of course, if I had my own cell phone,"
we could call captain black or a taxi or something.
"This is really not the time, Jade."
"Hey, Jackie."
"If you could have any wish in the world, what would you wish for?"
Peace.
We already have so many natural problems.
Earthquakes. Tornados. Hunger.
We've been killing so many people.
So many fighting going on.
We don't need human problems.
Really. I really need peace.
I'm in the woods.
"I'm tired, cold, and hungry,"
and I'm being hunted!
Aah!
"Jade, I thought you were going to gather firewood."
Hello. Have you learned nothing from the movies?
Whoever gets the firewood
is always the creeping terror's first victim.
So that's what happened to the other little girl
I sent out for firewood.
Very funny.
I thought Mr. excitement there was going to guide us
straight to the low-cost temple.
"""Lotus"" temple,"
and I didn't ask you to come along.
"Yeah, well, I didn't want to miss out"
on all the fun.
Ancient wisdom:
Crouching tiger is invisible
until teeth flash in moonlight.
"Well, duh. Can we go home?"
"Jade, it's very important"
that we locate the lotus temple.
Somewhere inside is the scroll of hung-chao.
It holds inscriptions of great power.
Ancient wisdom:
Words are breath that blows the fire of knowledge.
Yes! And our fire needs wood. Go.
"Oh, stay in sight of the camp."
"Stay in sight, like, I was going to..."
Get lost.
"Oh, boy. This is exactly what happens"
before the creeping terror shows up.
No problem.
I'll just retrace my steps.
Uhh!
Aah!
Ok. This was not here before.
(Crying)
Ohh.
You should not be here.
Why? What's the matter?
Why are you crying?
Run from this place. Please!
(Roars)
Whoa. Talk about a mood swing.
"Jade! Ohh, I told her to stay close."
She never listens.
Ancient wisdom:
The foolish monkey chases its tail
and catches trouble.
Mm. I should have brought a map.
Jade!
(Growls)
Uhh!
Ohh.
Aah!
This is exactly why
I didn't want to go get firewood.
(Roars)
(Growls)
Aah!
Aah!
Whew.
Aah!
(Growls)
Whoooooa!
(Growls)
Grrrrr.
Aah!
(Roars)
Psych.
(Roaring)
Whoooooa!
(Roaring in pain)
(Breathless) I humbly...
Beg forgiveness.
It is the power of the lotus temple
that changes me.
I am forced to guard it against all intruders.
"Yeah, well, you should put up"
a beware of monster sign or something.
"If you heard my tale, you would understand."
Please.
"Oh, man."
I'll listen...
As long as you don't get
"all ""grrr"" on me."
"5 years ago, on an evening like this,"
I wandered into the forest
against my father's wishes.
"It grew dark,"
and I was soon lost in the bamboo.
"Hey, same here."
"Then, under the light of the full moon,"
the lotus temple appeared.
"I thought it was a miracle,"
saving me from the cold.
"The next morning,"
"with the first rays of the sun,"
"the temple began to disappear,"
and I vanished along with it.
Hold the cell phone. Are you saying
this place only exists at night?
"Yes, and only under a full moon."
Anyone trapped within when the sun rises
becomes a temple guardian and may never leave again.
"Pretty good fairy tale,"
but there's one hole in your story.
Why weren't you attacked by a temple guardian?
The previous guardian
found the means to escape.
"I've searched 5 years for that secret,"
but have not found it.
I miss my family so much.
Hmm.
I'm all about beating the system.
Let's see.
You only go monstery
"about intruders, right?"
"So if you ask for my help,"
I'm not intruding. I'm helping.
"Please, would you enter and assist me?"
"But if I grow horns, flee at once!"
You got it.
I am xu-lin.
I'm Jade.
Jade! Jade!
"Oh, where is she?"
Bwaa!
Perhaps the little monkey is closer than you think.
The lotus temple.
Are you coming?
I will wait here.
I would not want to...
Intrude.
This is the library.
Here lies the wisdom of many ages.
Wow! I'll bet the secret to escape is written on one of these.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Xu-lin?!
Jade!
I'm changing.
There must be an intruder.
"Run, Jade! Hide!"
Hey! I'm a guest.
But I sure feel sorry for whoever--
uncle Jackie!
Jade?
(Growling)
Bwaa!
(Growls)
"Uh, heh heh."
(Growls) - Aah!
Bwaa!
"Uncle Jackie! Oh, man!"
Which way? Which way?
Unh! Ohh!
"Excuse me,"
I'm just looking for...
Bwaa! Aah!
Ow!
(Roars)
Huh?
(Gasps)
Aah! Unh!
(Coughs)
(Roars)
Unh!
(Gurgling)
Bwaa!
Bwaa!
The scroll of hung-chao.
Dah!
Oof!
(Coughing)
Ohh...
Yaah!
Huh?
Uncle Jackie!
Are you-- what have you done to xu-lin?!
She was a monster.
She attacked me.
"Ohh, ohh."
Duh! It's her job.
She's the temple guardian.
It's a bizarro temple power or something.
It turns her into a monster
whenever there are intruders.
Intruders?
I would not want to...
Intrude.
You knew about the temple guardian.
Of course. Ancient wisdom:
The worm realizes he is bait
only after the fish bites.
Yah! - Whoa! Ohh!
Hyah! Yah! Yah!
Yah!
Ugh! Intruders!
Tell me you aren't doing what I think you're doing.
Unh! Ugh!
Uncle Jackie?
(Growling)
Jade! Run!
No! Wrong way! Wrong way!
Xu-lin! Stop! That's my uncle.
"He's to help you, too!"
(Roars)
I don't think she wants my help!
"Ah, yes."
Intriguing.
Jade: Oh!
Jade!
I'm ok. Help xu-lin!
Jade!
(Xu-lin moans)
Ancient wisdom:
The cornered rat finds peace...
In eternity.
The door!
"Uncle Jackie, wait!"
Ow!
"I tried to tell you, she's trapped here."
It's some kind of curse.
Ohh.
"Leave me, Jade. Escape while you can."
No! We're going to find a cure
or an antidote or something.
"Right, uncle Jackie?"
We will try.
Unh! Aah!
"Jade, I'm changing."
No biggie.
"Stay calm. Just try to remember,"
I am your guest and uncle Jackie...
He is invited.
Good girl!
No more palm blasting!
You think that is the only power
granted by the scroll of hung-chao?
<i>Haison! Haison! Haison!</i>
"Xu-lin, what happened with the monster bit?"
Go hulk already!
Too weak.
Huh? Unh!
Ancient wisdom: The wise man never walks out
on free entertainment.
Hey! How come you can leave the temple?
Xu-lin? Wake up! Wake up!
"Get him, uncle Jackie!"
Get who?
"Jackie,"
your hands! Look!
Huh?
No more palm blasting!
The inscriptions.
"Give armor-boy a taste of hung-chao mojo, quick!"
No!
Xu-lin! Come on!
Ohh.
Both: Uh-oh.
(Roars)
No!
<i>Fung dah! Fung dah!</i>
Ruh! - <i>Fung dah! Fung dah!</i>
(Monk straining)
"Uncle Jackie, the sun's coming up!"
Good.
"You don't understand. The temple vanishes at Dawn,"
and anyone inside goes with it.
How many crazy rules does this temple have?
You go! I will save xu-lin!
Raah!
Come on!
It will not work.
The power of the temple will not let me leave.
The armor...
It can leave the temple.
Yes!
Jackie: Whooaa!
(Coughing) Whew.
Noooo!
"Heh. Easy come, easy go."
"Oh, thank you for freeing me."
At least the scroll of hung-chao is destroyed.
No one else will learn its dangerous secret.
"You know, I'll bet we could redraw those inscriptions"
on your hands.
"I mean, it'd take a few tries--"
"Jade, playing with magic is too dangerous."
I only hope to once again see my parents
and have nothing more to do with magic ever again!
"Come on. Where's your spirit of adventure, xu-lin?"
Ancient wisdom:
Wise monkey knows when to stifle spirit of adventure
and concentrate on schoolwork.
You just made that up.
"No. It's old, very old."
"Hey, Jackie, where did you live when you were little?"
"After my father, for the living,"
"he had to go to Australia, American embassy."
"As soon as my father move, then I have nowhere to live,"
so they put me - to the martial opera school.
"Inside, just like the movie called <i> fame.</i>"
One thing's different is we have to stay there.
"We stay, live there, eat there."
"Teach you how to dance, how to kicking, punch,"
"somersault, acrobatic, all kind of things."
"School is very, very important."
"Education is very, very important."
"Roberta, why are you up? It's not even morning."
"The goats-- they're afraid, mama."
Maybe it's the...
(Whispering) Chupacabra.
"(Laughs) Oh, little one, there is no chupacabra."
It's just a story we tell
so that small children will stay inside at night.
Like they have been told to?
But the goats?
They will be fine.
(Growling)
(Banging)
(Growling)
(Gasps)
(Howling)
The chupacabra is real!
(Baaa)
Jackie: Incredible!
Incredibly boring.
What kind of lame pyramid is this?
"No mummy curses, no booby traps,"
no bonus points?
"Oh, this is not a video game, Jade."
This is important research.
(Growls)
I have had enough work for one day.
It is quitting time. Bye-bye.
Faster! Go faster!
I am not a horse!
Faster! Go faster!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Senor Jackie, it is I, El toro."
I have unfortunate news.
An ancient evil plagues my people.
It is the goat-eater...
The chupacabra.
Chupacabra? But that is just a fairy tale!
No...It is a real evil
from which grown men hide like frightened children
and no goat is safe.
"Uhh, Jackie?"
"Uh, El toro, I am a little busy right now."
May I call you back?
El toro: Of course.
But the sun will soon set
"and I need your help, my friend."
I know of ancient tablets
which tell the legend of the chupacabra.
They may reveal a method to rid us of the beast.
I need you to translate.
Jackie: As long as nothing chases me!
Aah! - Aah!
"We'll be there, El toro."
"Jade: You know, you should really get voice mail."
<i>Hola!</i>
Eww. You didn't tell me paco would be here.
"It is good to see you, too, seorita Jade."
(Kiss)
"Come, Jackie. We must prepare to battle the chupacabra."
"Wait, wait, wait!"
You said you only needed me
to translate ancient tablets.
There is no time. The beast attacks by dark of night.
"This rocks, paco!"
Jackie's gonna kick butt on the chalupa-cabra thingy.
No. El toro will destroy the beast.
No. Jackie.
The mouse man?
Jackie is not a mouse man!
Is too. - Is not.
Is not. - Is too.
Is too. - Is not.
Mother: It is just as we told El toro!
The chupacabra attacked our house!
And exactly what did the creature look like?
It was giant...
With glowing red eyes!
"Fur! Fangs! Oh! Claws, too!"
"And it howled like this-- ""arroooo!"""
"Yep, sounds like a Chimichanga to me."
Now do you believe?
I believe that we are talking about a coyote.
What?
Aah! That is not a coyote!
(Roars)
Everybody inside! Bolt the door!
"Hello, Mr. chupacabra."
You look like you're having a very bad night.
Do you have a splinter in your paw?
Perhaps we can help.
(Snarling)
Waah!
"Stay beside me, Jade. I will keep you safe."
(Growling)
Sorry! No solicitors!
(Growling)
Is there another way out?
No!
It's after the goat! Let's just give it to--
don't even finish that sentence.
Yaah!
Jackie: You do not want to eat me! I am not a goat!
(El toro groans)
(Snarls)
"Fear not! The beast is no match for El toro, the bull!"
"And El Jackie, the, uh, the chan!"
Hyah! - Hyah!
(Growls)
Jackie: Huh!
Ow!
That's one point for Jackie.
No. That's one point for El toro.
Jackie made contact first.
Did not. - Did too.
Did too! - Did not!
(Growls)
<i>Never</i> touch the mask!
Unh!
(Both grunting)
You all right?
I am fine. A scratch here or there.
"Mother: El toro, you have saved us all!"
You destroyed the chupacabra!
"It was not me, paco."
It appears that sunlight is the Victor.
That's one point for sunlight.
It does not matter.
El toro is the greatest hero in the world!
Jackie is. Is not.
Is too. - Is not.
Is not. - Is too.
"Children, please. We must celebrate!"
(Music playing)
(Laughing and talking)
The goats are afraid...
As if the chupacabra is near.
"Oh, that is crazy talk."
"Perhaps not, my friend."
Do not let the children know.
The beast wounded me...
But it is a small injury
to which I would normally give no notice.
I fear that I have been tainted by the creature's evil...
Infected by its ancient malevolence.
Take me to the tablets you needed me to translate.
"The beast hunts by night, hides by day..."
It feeds on livestock and goats...
Sunlight will destroy the beast.
"Ahh, my friend, I fear you must translate more quickly."
I feel like I am missing something obvious.
"Oh, wait! Here it is!"
(Growling)
"""Beware of the chupacabra's claw..."
"""The evil can be transferred from beast to man"
"and the man will become the beast!"""
Bad news--aah!
(Roaring)
Ohh!
Run! Run! Run!
The chupacabra is loose!
Nice costume. We go together.
(Roars)
(Screaming)
Aah!
Aah!
Huh? I thought the candelabra thingy was history.
Hey! I recognize that mask!
Yoo-hoo! Yummy goat right here!
(Roars)
I did not mean to touch your mask. Sorry.
Jade: That's one point for Jackie...
For whatever you just did.
"Jackie's so fast,"
sometimes the eye can't catch it.
Where's El toro?
"Paco, that was El toro."
It's the curse of the chupacabra.
El toro is no longer the bull.
He is...El toro'cabra.
Noooo!
Don't worry. I already called for help.
"The flight was delayed, the food was terrible,"
"the movie had no plot, and I had turbulence!"
Can you cure El toro?
Do not rush the chi!
(Exhales)
I have all but one ingredient.
A powder made from capsicum.
I have never heard of capsicum.
It can break the chupacabra curse?
No! It is only one ingredient!
Does no one listen to me?
One more thing!
"To find the best capsicum, we must visit the wise elder"
atop El picacho del diablo--
the mountain of the devil!
Can you move any more slowly?
Why do I have to carry everything?
You want the children to break their backs?
And my hands hold the map!
I would feel a lot better
if that map were right side up.
"Look, uncle knows what's what."
We'll be fine. Don't worry.
My worry is only for the world's greatest hero--El toro!
Because his fate is in the hands of a puny mouse man.
Jackie is not a mouse man!
Is too.
(Gasps)
(Roaring)
Jackie: Go! Go! Go!
Paco: El toro!
It's me! Paco!
I do not want to hurt you!
"El toro--I mean, Mr. El toro'cabra,"
we do not have any goats. Why are you attacking us?
Jackie: Oh! The mask!
"Paco, drop the mask and run!"
No! I will never abandon the mask of El toro fuertes! Aah!
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!
Throw him this!
You are not an animal! You are the bull!
(Growling)
"Oh, ok, bull is an animal,"
but it is only a nickname! Oh!
"Ok, that's one point for Jackie,"
but I don't like this game anymore.
"It will be ""game over"" in a minute."
I cannot let that happen.
"El toro, this way! It's me, paco!"
Don't you remember? I am your greatest fan!
Let me help you!
"No, paco! Don't!"
(Howls)
"Sorry again,"
but we had to get you out of the sunlight.
"Jackie, my friend, you have succeeded!"
You have lifted the curse of the chupacabra.
I am El toro again! Thank you!
Uh...
El toro!
I saved your mask.
I do not understand.
We didn't do anything to lift the curse.
Aah! The sun!
I--I am still cursed.
That explains why the chupacabra only hunts at night.
Take it. I do not deserve to wear it.
I am still the goat-eater.
Stop whining!
We just need to find some capsicum!
But you said it is on top of the mountain!
We'll never make it there and back by nightfall.
And by then...
By then I will have become the beast once more.
"Uh, excuse me, elder..."
Can you tell us where we might find some capsicum?
We need capsicum for an antidote.
I do not give out my capsicum to just anybody.
Go away.
But my friend has been turned into an chupacabra!
(Gasps) Chupacabra!
Here. - All the capsicum you could want.
(Grunting) No! Must fight!
To remain human!
Aah--arooo!
"El toro, we have the--aah!"
(Snarling)
El toro!
Paco: No!
(Roars)
Always make a backup. Make sure he drinks it all!
(Roars)
Ohh!
Skael!
(Gagging)
The magic is not working!
Maybe I should have put in more wood spurge.
<i>Ol'!</i> The bull is back!
El toro! Your mask!
Thank you.
I knew you would keep it safe.
One more thing!
"El toro, do not go swimming for half an hour."
"Now, let me go home!"
Jackie's back to mucho bonus points.
"Admit it, paco. He's the greatest."
No way! El toro gets mucho mega bonus points
for living through the chupacabra curse.
Your mouse man is the second greatest.
"No, he's not."
"Yes, he is!"
No! - Yes! - No! - Yes!
"Man: Hey, Jackie! Who's your role model?"
"When I was young, of course, some of my teachers,"
I just think they're great.
"But later on, when I'm growing up,"
"when I'm making a movie,"
then I find out my role model--
"Charlie chaplin, Harold Lloyd, buster Keaton."
How difficult that they made a movie.
"Because in that day,"
"silent movie without all the special effect,"
"without all the protection,"
they still do a great stunt. That's my goal.
"One day, I want to be them."
"Anybody better than me, that's my role model."
Ah. Always come back from Reno estate sale
with good finds for shop!
"Yes, uncle. And always such big finds."
You should buy bigger car!
More trunk space.
More trunk space is so not a bad idea.
Jackie: Look! Old west ghost town!
Oh! We must visit.
Ay-eee-ahh! Ghosts are nothing to trifle with!
Tch. Ghost town
just means old and deserted
and boring.
I've heard that my great-great-grandfather
came out west and lived in a cowboy town.
I'm curious to see what one looks like.
Driver's privilege.
Any ghost here
better not show face!
You do not want to mess with uncle's herbs!
Hmm. Not much here.
Duh!
(Gasps) Ghost!
(Gasps) Ayyy-yaaa!
Ghost?
Kind of.
The ghost of Jackie.
"<i>""The Hong Kong kid.""</i>"
Ahhh-yaaa!
Do not scare uncle like that!
Amazing! The picture looks just like me!
This book must be about my great-great-grandfather.
Fine. Take home. Make good bedtime story.
I wanna hear it now.
"Me, too."
Ahem.
"""It was the end of a long day"
"for the men and women working to build the new railroad."""
(Toot)
"Ok, people. Time to knock off."
Whew! This is thirsty work.
I'm going to town for a nice frosty ginger ale.
"Care to join me, friend?"
Railroad workers are not welcome in town.
"Oh, don't be silly. We are in America now."
We can go anywhere we please.
(Humming)
"Oh, hello."
Good day.
"Hot one, isn't it?"
Ah...A cafe.
(Boisterous conversation)
"Uh...Howdy, partners?"
"Well, looky here, boys."
We got us a railroad worker.
Railroad workers ain't allowed in this here establishment.
"Ain't that right, Maureen?"
I don't want no trouble here.
"Oh, no trouble, ma'am. I would just like a ginger ale"
"with lots of ice, please. Very thirsty."
"I've been working on the railroad, uh..."
All the livelong day?
We can't have no lawman
"sticking his nose in our business, mayor."
And you shan't.
"I took care of the last sheriff, didn't I?"
Yeah. Well...
It's the next one we gotta worry about.
Can't risk nobody putting the kibosh on our big plan.
Hmm. I see your point.
So why not pick a patsy for the job?
Someone who'd offer no resistance...
A bumbler. A fool.
Someone like...
That was not very nice of you--
ooh!
Him.
"This is a very great honor, Mr. mayor."
But why me?
"Well, because you're..."
A railroad worker!
And railroad workers
always make the best sheriffs.
I did not know that. I won't let you down.
"No, I'm quite sure you won't."
Niece: Uncle Jackie?
Uh...I am Jackie.
I am your niece...
Just arrived from Hong Kong.
This is so cool!
"She's my long-lost, great-great something or other!"
I betcha she looked exactly like me.
"Actually, it says here that the sheriff's niece"
was very tall and 15 years old.
Must be a typo.
I trust the preparations are complete?
"Indeed they are, shendu."
"The stagecoach comes through town tomorrow morning,"
and the gold and the antiquities
bound for the new San Francisco museum
shall be on board.
And among those antiquities
"the horse talisman,"
possessing the power to free me from this miserable stone casement!
You do remember our little deal.
"Once free, you will help us get even more gold."
"Uh, at your earliest convenience, of course."
"You'll probably want to freshen up, stretch the old legs--"
and what steps have you taken
to prevent any interference?
I've handpicked a new sheriff.
A real find.
Yeech. I hate unpacking. It is <i> such</i> hard work.
You should try building a railroad.
"""The sheriff"
"""soon earned the respect of the townspeople"
"because of his bravery and heroism."""
"Oh, it's black Bart, sheriff!"
He's loose!
"Oh, bad outlaw?"
My cat!
He won't come down off that roof!
"Here, kitty kitty."
Got you!
Whoa!
Whoa-oa-oa!
Uh--
old lady: Oh!
Naughty little black Bart!
You had mama worried sick.
"Oh, thank you, sheriff."
You're welcome.
"Niece, I will see you"
when the big hand is on the 6.
"""The town had never had a lawman like sheriff Jackie."
"""No lawbreaker was immune from his tough"
"but fair brand of frontier justice."""
You will have to pick those up.
We have very strict laws against littering.
"Just feedin' my mule, sheriff."
"I can appreciate that,"
"but I was hired to clean up this town, so..."
"So you either throw 'em in the trash can,"
or we throw you in the pokey.
"Ha ha! Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, girlie."
Girlie? <i> I</i> happen to be his deputy.
"Niece, you are not my deputy."
But she is right about--oh!
"""The job sometimes got rough,"
"""but wet or dry,"
"the sheriff would always get his man."""
Perhaps a night in jail will make you think twice
before breaking the law again.
Uh-oh.
I would like you
to go talk to the mayor.
Deputy business?
Uh...Yes! Jail cell needs repair.
Tch! Fine.
Doubt Annie oakley started out like this.
This new sheriff's
"a real burr in my saddle, mayor."
Thought he was supposed to be a patsy.
"Oh, please."
Apprehending litterbugs?
Saving kittens?
This fellow's nothing but a dim bulb
with a shiny badge.
I guarantee our stagecoach heist
will go off without a hitch.
"Well, well, well."
"We've got us a no-good, snoopin' little varmint."
What do you think we ought to do with her?
"How's about we tie her to a cactus out on the prairie,"
let the buzzards decide?
"Jackie, reading: ""There she was, the sheriff's niece,"
"""caught red-handed spying on the bad guys."
"Suddenly, she opened her mouth and--"""
(speaking Chinese)
She obviously understands no English.
Let her go.
"Whoa! Now, that was one smooth move."
"""The niece tipped off the sheriff"
"about what she had heard."""
The mayor? Those nice men?
"Oh, you must have misunderstood."
Hello!
"I was the one talking Chinese, not them!"
I understood perfectly!
"Uh, yes."
I am heading out to pay a visit to an old friend.
Please mind the office.
Right! And work on the case.
"Hey, quite a load you're carryin'!"
"Payroll for every town from here to Tahoe,"
plus some far-east artifacts
for that new museum in San Fran.
"Well, thanks, partner."
See you next month.
It's so shiny!
I Polish it often.
Ah...From railroad worker to sheriff.
It seems... Impossible.
"Actually, railroad workers make the best sheriffs."
I did not know that.
Hey-yah!
"Tch, tch, tch."
Speeding in a railroad construction zone.
"Please, stop the--oh!"
(Coughing)
You are speeding!
Pull over!
Oh!
Uh-oh.
(Small voice) Ow.
"Hey, this stage is carrying government--"
aah! Oof!
Deputy niece to the rescue!
Deputy niece must wait here.
I'm talkin' some serious dinero!
Please pull over!
"He said please! Yeah, right!"
I guess here is where I earn my pay.
Ow! Oh--gaaah!
Oh--oh--ow--ow! Bad day!
Bad day!
Wha--aah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You are in very big trouble!
Not as big as you!
Uh--ravine! Hit the brakes!
"Sorry, railroad worker."
I'm off this train!
Aah! Bad day at black rock!
"Jackie, reading: ""It looked like curtains"
"for sheriff Jackie, when--"" huh?"
Why did you stop? What happened next?
The page is missing!
"Boring story, anyway."
Baa! That is the fate of my great-great-grandfather
that you are using to clean your glasses!
(Clears throat)
"""In a spectacular feat of derring-do,"
"sheriff Jackie took control of the reins."""
"Thank you, sheriff."
There's a whole lotta folks counting on that cargo
for their paychecks.
Just doin' my job.
"I grow impatient, valmont!"
I trust your men were able to pull off a simple robbery.
"Rest assured, shendu,"
my boys will be
rendezvousing with us momentarily.
You see?
Uh...Ran into a little trouble.
That sheriff you hired.
You didn't get the gold?!
Shendu: Fools!
"Hey, hold on, shen-dude."
Ain't exactly like we came back empty-handed.
(Clicks tongue)
"Got the horse off the stagecoach, just like you asked."
I didn't want the horse!
I wanted the horse talisman!
Oh. Uh...
What's a talisman?
"Valmont: You have my word, shendu."
They will be tarred and feathered.
But first things first--
this meddling sheriff must pay.
Count me out. That guy ain't human.
And that is why you shall use magic to defeat him.
So...How do we work 'em?
You don't. The magic works by itself.
Neat-o.
You dare to spy on <i> me?!</i>
Uh-oh...
Whoa!
The stagecoach company will probably give you a big reward.
"""Meet us for a showdown at the lucky corral at high noon."
"Signed, the bad guys."""
"Oh, this is very bad."
What are you talking about?
"You bushwhacked 'em last time, didn't you? You'll do it again."
No. They will be using powerful...
Unh...Unh.
Powerful what? Tell me!
"""Sheriff Jackie was very worried,"
"""certain he would lose the showdown"
"""now that the bad guys would be using powerful something."
"""But then his niece saw something through the window"
"that gave her hope."""
Who is that?
A very wise man from the old country.
Who will be the first to try my Shanghai surprise elixir?
Very powerful. Good for digestion.
Hi. Remember me?
"Ah, girl from Hong Kong. Look different."
Thought you were 15 and taller.
It was a typo.
Ahh...Now story getting interesting.
See? I told--ow.
Keep reading.
"""After he finished selling 10 bottles"
"""of good-for-digestion elixir,"
"""the peddler took the sheriff and his niece"
"into the back of his wagon."""
"Oh, what is that, an immortality potion?"
Green tea. Drink.
"Uh, no, thank you."
"I--I do not mean to be rude, but as I told you,"
I have been challenged
to a big showdown at high noon.
We were sort of hoping you had some of that
wise-wizard-from- the-old-country kind of advice.
I do. Don't go.
"That's it, ""don't go""?"
Best I could do on short notice.
I have to go.
It is my sworn duty as a sheriff.
Soon to be ex-sheriff.
"""The old clock tower struck high noon"
"as sheriff Jackie--"" oh..."
"What's up, Jackie? Keep reading."
I can't. I never learned what became of my great-great-grandfather.
What if this was his last roundup?
Give it here! Uncle hate suspense.
"""Old clock tower struck high noon"
"""as sheriff Jackie started long walk to lucky corral."
"""From opposite direction,"
"outlaws headed that way as well."""
"""Let's do this,"" said the bad guy."
"""T?"" What's that supposed to mean,"
he wants some tea?
"Time-out. No firearms, ok?"
A fair fight.
"Fair fight? Sure. No problem-o, amigo."
"Gotta tip my hat to you, sheriff."
Anytime now.
"Ahh, magic."
"Oh, more bad day, more bad day!"
You forgot your hat.
Huh?
(Muffled grumbling)
"Oh, this ought to be good."
Daaaaahhhhh!
"Ohh, ohh, ohh."
Wee-hah! Hog-tied like a heifer.
Ohh.
"Hold this, please."
Huh? What the--
"whoa, whoa. Guuh."
(Grunts)
"Uh, we had an agreement-- no firearms."
Guess I missed that meeting.
Ever been locked in a 4-foot stall with a bucking bronco?
Once.
"Jade: ¶ oh, Mr. mayor... ¶"
huh?
"Hmm, Shanghai surprise good for digestion,"
bad for everything else.
I hope you all enjoy your new home.
"I reckon we had you wrong, sheriff."
You're ok.
Like to thank you for cleaning up the town.
"Oh, well, you know what they say--"
railroad workers always make the best sheriffs.
Speaking of which...
Please welcome your new sheriff.
New sheriff?
"Hmm, shiny."
"I am retiring. I miss the fresh air, the open spaces."
I am going back to the railroad.
Looks like peddler has new assistant.
Really?
Cool. What do I do?
Make tea.
Ach...
"Uh, old peddler man, where are you heading?"
Railroad is the other way.
Forget railroad.
Plenty more bottle of elixir to sell.
Yeah. And plenty more towns
that need cleaning up.
"""And off they rode, into sunset. The end."""
"Oh, it is nice to know"
that my ancestor was such a hero.
-Jackie a hero? -Jackie a hero?
Hoo! - Ha!
It was old-west Jade who saved his butt.
You're crazy. Old peddler man saved day.
"Hey, Jackie?"
Yes?
What's your Chinese name?
"My real, real, real name"
is called fong shu lo.
"In the school in Australia,"
"they asked me, ""what's your name?"""
"I said, ""my name Chang Kong sun."""
"""No, no, no."
"Ok, your name Steven."""
"Yeah, I becoming a Steven."
"In the factory,"
the building bilker asked me what's my name.
"My friend said, ""Jack."""
J-a-c-k.
"Then, after I know a little bit English,"
then a j-a-c--Jackie.
I think I like rhythm.
Jackie.
(French accent) Jackie.
"Amber, it is good to see you again."
I'm so pleased you could come.
The painting is right through here.
It is not listed in our official inventory.
"It might be quite valuable, if it is authentic."
That is what I am here for.
"Northern song dynasty, 11th century,"
ink and pale color on silk. It's beautiful.
An authentic Chinese masterpiece.
<i>C'est formidable.</i>
One moment while I fetch the authentication forms.
Hey!
Put that back.
Huh?
Yaah!
"All right, Mr. fold-up man,"
"thank you for showing the painting some fresh air,"
but I will take that back now.
No!
Not fair.
"You claim a fold-up man stole ze painting,"
"slipped between the bars,"
"transformed into a bird, and flew away?"
I'll show you.
"He bend like this, folded like that,"
"twisted over, then again, then he look just like this."
"Uh, but more bird-shaped."
"Monsieur chan, I will thank you"
"not to destroy my notes, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>"
Heh heh.
"Hi, Jackie."
"Jade, you were supposed to be taking a tour of Paris."
T'cha. You've obviously
never been on a tour bus with uncle.
You drive too fast.
How can uncle see the sights?
Slow down.
I told him I was having lunch with you.
He bought it.
What's with the look?
Did that painting turn out to be bogus?
No. It was a true masterpiece.
"But a fold-up man stole it, turned into a bird,"
and flew away.
Fold-up man.
"That is what the police said, too."
"Ah, poor Amber. She will be in trouble with her bosses."
I must retrieve the painting somehow.
Lucky you got me.
I read in a comic book once--
"to catch a thief, - you must think like a thief."
But I am no good at thinking like a thief.
"Yeah, I know."
That's why I recommend we find some expert help.
Viper!
Jade.
What's with him?
Nothing. He's just having a hissy
about you being a bad influence on me because you're a thief.
<i>Former</i> thief.
Now I'm a security consultant for the becktul corporation.
And Jade tells me you need some assistance.
"No, thank you."
I have enough problems with one criminal.
"Oh, come on, Jackie. Viper's a good guy now."
"Here, viper."
The painting stealer left this behind.
Where did you find that?
"Ah, yes. They call him origami."
Huh?
You know this guy?
I've heard only a rumor of a mastermind
"who leaves origami animals at all his thefts,"
like a calling card.
And can he fold himself into different shapes?
I've never heard that.
There is one person who might know more.
But...
But what?
But you don't want my help.
The fox. This is home base for every crook in Paris.
The proprietor is an old friend.
Cool. A wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Come on. Jade...
"If I let you come inside, you must do everything I say."
"First, touch nothing. Second, see nothing."
"Third, talk to--"
hey! Ooh.
Excuse me. - Just passing through.
Waah...My bad. Gooh! Do not get up.
I am new here.
I do not like this place.
"(French accent) Viper, I heard you went legit."
You heard right.
"Listen, fox, I need some 411."
What can you tell me about this?
"Ah, <i> oui.</i> Origami."
He only steals the finest of far-east art.
They say he has magical powers.
Cool.
"The way I heard it told,"
he was just a small-timer:
"Vending machines, picking pockets,"
"little penny-ante heists,"
"until one day,"
he found an enchanted square of paper
with the power - to transform the paper...
"Well, let's just say it remade him."
"Now he has some kind of folding power,"
"if you believe that sort of thing,"
which I don't.
But it is true. I saw origami with my own eyes.
(Gasps) Did you see his henchmen:
The easter bunny - and the tooth fairy as well?
That was useless.
I already knew the thief could fold up.
"Yeah, but now we also know"
he only steals - the finest far-east art.
"Hey, the kid's a good listener."
How come you never listen to the things I say?
"For example, stay with uncle."
"Oh, man."
Kuniko kasahara of kasahara exports.
He possesses more far-east art than the far east itself.
It's just a matter of time before origami shows up to rob the place.
"Look, we have to warn Mr. kasahara."
Have you never heard of a stakeout?
"That means we hide and keep watch,"
with the emphasis on hide.
Hey!
"Hello, Jade. Glad you could make it."
May I help you?
"Mr. kasahara, sir,"
your art collection is in danger.
"There is a thief who, uh, is very resourceful."
I would like to offer my assistance.
"Please leave my doorstep, mister..."
Chan. Jackie chan.
"Go away, chan Jackie chan."
I will not pay for your protection.
My protection? I'm not trying to blackmail anyone.
Huh? Viper?
"Ahh, Jade?"
You are supposed to be with uncle.
T'cha.
You are driving too slow.
I want to see all of Paris before I get old.
Don't have a cow.
I told him I was meeting you for a movie.
Shh! Someone's coming.
"Oh, it's just that kasahara dude."
Jade should not be running around rooftops with thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Better she learns how to catch bad guys from a pro.
Jade does not need to know how to catch bad guys.
But you do.
"Whoa, he's folded. He's origam--aah."
"Ah, another masterpiece for my eyes only."
It's him. Kasahara is origami.
That painting does not belong to you.
"Ah, Mr. chan Jackie chan."
Return the painting to the university.
Why? So it can end up in a museum?
Aah!
No more games. I know who you are.
Origami.
I'm sure we both agree there is nothing to be gained
by my denying it!
"Jackie! Jade, wait."
Jumping into a fight before you're needed
usually makes things worse.
But...
"Ok, now he needs help, but you stay here."
"Oh, man."
Ow!
Ooh. Paper cut. That's the worst.
Both: Yaah!
Unh.
"Jackie, swords."
Scissor beats paper.
Police. Stay where you are.
"Detective, I found the fold-up man. He's over here."
What is this madness?
"Mr. kasahara, sir, are you all right?"
This man is crazy. He is dangerous.
He destroyed my gallery
and attacked me with my own 12th-century swords.
No! He's lying.
He changed back to a normal man.
It's true.
"Kuniko kasahara is origami, the master thief."
"Mmm, are you not a thief yourself, huh?"
"La viper, I believe."
"Uh, run."
Huh?
(Panting)
After them!
"Jade: Well, now we know kasahara built such a large collection"
of far-east art.
But now the police think I am crazy and dangerous.
You know what we have to do.
We have to catch origami in the act.
You will stay with uncle.
Breaking into the louvre.
I've been planning this in my head for years.
"Remember, we are here to catch origami."
Do not steal anything.
Don't you trust me?
"No, I do not."
Jade?!
"T'cha, like a daytime tour with uncle was so much fun,"
you thought I'd wanna go on a nighttime one?
It is too dark to see anything.
Is not Paris the city of lights?
Make it brighter.
And I actually told uncle I'd be meeting you at the louvre.
You are a bad influence.
<i>Moi?</i>
Aha. Right where it's supposed to be.
The ming exhibit.
Be careful. Any one of these paintings
could be origami incognito.
There he is! (Alarm sounds)
What?
Whoa.
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Hyah!
Viper!
I knew she would betray us.
I heard that.
"See, Jackie? I told you viper's a good guy now."
Hmm...
Halt! You are all under arrest.
You don't want us.
You want the fold-up man.
"Eh, <i> oui, oui,</i> à the paper fold-up man."
I have heard all about it for the last time.
"No, no. He is right there."
(Grunting)
(Gasps) A fold-up man.
The urn is too heavy for him to fly away.
<i>S'arreter!</i>
Is this one of those times
when it's better to wait before jumping in?
No.
(Tires squeal)
Oomph. Fine. You take the wheel.
I'll just take this.
(Car horn honking)
"Sorry, uncle. I'll see you later."
Don't miss the louvre. Bye-bye.
Stealing a police car. Shame on you.
Didn't you just steal that urn
from Mr. kasahara?
That is different.
Here he comes.
"Uh, I can't see anything."
Stop. The tower is closed.
Jade?
I'm fine.
"Viper, look after Jade. Call the police."
Wait. Did he just ask me to look after you?
Duh. Jackie likes you.
How about that?
"Origami, look at me."
I have a rare porcelain urn from the kilns of jingdezhen.
Ohh.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Aah!
Ohh.
Waah!
"Uh, wrong floor."
"Well, chan Jackie chan,"
it appears you are down to 2 options--
hand over the urn or jump.
The police already know the truth.
They saw you try to fly away.
They will think it was only their eyes playing tricks on them.
No one believes there can be a paper fold-up man.
All right. You win.
Hey! Ohh!
(Grunts)
Ah...
"<i>Merci, Jackie.</i>"
"Was the thief a fold-up man, like you said?"
"Uh, no. My eyes played tricks on me."
It was just a normal thief.
"Just a normal thief, huh?"
Then I guess you really didn't need my help.
That is right. No help.
I understand.
Ow.
Do you know how long I was stuck in that bus
with cheese on my face?
I said I was sorry. Ow!
"Hey, Jackie... Yes?"
Where did you grow up?
I grow up in Hong Kong...
In apartment...With...
French embassy.
"My father was a cook, my mother a maid."
"So when I was young, I speak perfect French."
The ambassador-- she's very good.
She loved me playing with her children.
"Except when I sleep, back to behind the kitchen."
Haven't you found it yet?
"Uh, not yet, uncle."
"But tell me, why am I researching"
Celtic pig goddesses?
Do not waste time asking questions.
Read.
One more thing. Jade is--
bored!
"Uncle Jackie,"
when are you going to score us a mission?
"Jade, I am not a secret agent."
I am a researcher.
But do not worry.
"When I come home,"
"we will make a big bowl of popcorn,"
and you can help me proofread my notes.
(Dial tone)
Hello?
(Exasperated sigh)
Doing homework all day?
Somebody around here
must believe in life after breakfast.
"Gentlemen, we have an emergency."
Black: Criminal mastermind Dr. ashby necrosis is back.
"Dr. necrosis,"
the kingpin of techno-crime?
The same.
Reports are that he has developed
a cutting-edge high-tech doomsday device.
The entire world is in jeopardy.
"We've located what we believe to be the doctor's base,"
"the necropolis, - inside this dormant volcano."
Someone must infiltrate the necropolis
and destroy the doomsday weapon.
I suggest Taggart mcstone.
"Unfortunately, - agent tag retired last year."
He left the spy game forever.
Never say forever.
Agent tag!
I'll require the standard infiltration package--
my briefcase and a fresh suit.
"Italian, of course."
Of course.
"Good luck, tag."
"If I'm not back by 8:00,"
cancel my reservation at Chez Louis.
(Vibrating)
Hmm. Running rough.
Cargo must have shifted.
Aah-aah-aah-aah aah-aah-aah aah...
(Grunt)
510...
511...
"Captain black,"
I cannot find Jade anywhere.
Uhh! Whoo!
Good. We have a major operation going down
and I can't risk her being underfoot.
Yah!
Jade is always underfoot.
"If she is not under my feet and not under your feet,"
whose feet is she under?
"Oh, no."
"Comm-one,"
get me agent Taggart mcstone.
"Yes, sir. Homebase to outfield."
Homebase to outfield.
Jade.
"No can do, sir."
Agent tag is flying under radio silence.
"Hmm. 34 down, 6 letters."
Celtic pig goddess.
(Beeping)
Computer: Approaching target.
Autopilot off.
Yaah!
Aah!
I spy with my little eye...
Something beginning with...
Secret base.
Uhh! Ooh! Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!
"Aw, come on."
How am I supposed to keep up with that?
Hmm.
Sledding in July.
Cowabunga!
Works better with snow.
Wha--ohh!
(Jade gasping)
Hyah!
Mission log:
Enemy unconscious.
Borrowing crudely tailored jumpsuit as a disguise.
Note: Orange is not my color.
(Gasp)
Whoops! A blast!
Hurry!
Jade may be in terrible danger!
I'm sure tag has everything under control.
You think so?
No.
"Jackie, are you sure you want to do this?"
I'm sure.
I think.
Yaaaahhh!
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
Uh...
Captain black sent me.
Hmm. A little girl with dark hair
who tags along and is an obvious liar.
I've heard of you.
You're Jade.
Section 13 has classified you
as the ultimate security risk.
You've jeopardized my mission!
Whoa.
"And you need to calm down, captain blood pressure."
Mission log: Aborted.
I'll take you back to San Francisco at once.
Ohh...
"Let go of her, you big bully!"
Jade! I'll be back!
Jackie?
Yeeaaaahhh!
(Crash)
(Moaning)
Huh? Ohh...
Uh-oh.
Jackie! No!
Agent tag!
Wake up!
Huh? Tag?
Now who's going to defeat Dr. necrosis
and destroy his doomsday device?
Uncle Jackie?
"Oh, no."
Destroying a doomsday device
sounds too dangerous.
"Well, sure, if you say it like that."
"I told you,"
I am not a secret agent.
I am a researcher.
All you have to do is save the world.
No.
I'm taking all 3 of us
back to section 13 right away.
See? This is why we can't buy you nice things.
Whoopsie! Incoming!
Get 'em!
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"Agent tag, please, wake up."
Admit it.
This is better than doing homework all day.
"No, it is not."
Now--uhh!
Uhh--ooh! Uhh!
(Grunting)
Uhh!
Ooh. Careful you don't hurt agent tag.
Him?! What about me?
Gohh--
uncle Jackie!
This way!
"Jade, no!"
Daahh!
Get him!
Whoaaaaa!
(Coughing)
Automated voice: Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
We gotta find that doomsday device! Come on!
Ohh! Why do you refuse to wake up?
"All right, then."
Stay here.
Try not to attract attention.
Perfect.
Jade?
Jade?!
Ohh!
(Footsteps)
Shh! Someone's coming.
Jackie?
Jackie?
Whaa--
doomsday device.
You fools!
You need me!
I spent 20 years designing the laser Cannon.
Huh! Last year's technology.
"Dr. necrosis has a new doomsday toy,"
all packed up and ready for transport.
Transport?
Loading dock.
Hoyle.
I have deduced the identity of our intruder.
Taggart mcstone.
That wild card still in the game?
But I thought he folded last year.
There is no one else it could be.
He is the only human
capable of infiltrating my necropolis.
"Oh, how I long to meet my Nemesis"
face to face.
"You won't ruin his face,"
"will you, hoyle?"
No promises.
"For years he has foiled all my techno-plans,"
"but this time we have the druid stone,"
and even agent tag cannot defeat its ancient magic.
The world is ours.
We hold all the cards.
We have the upper hand.
We--
we could take it down a notch
on the card puns.
All that matters is the druid stone.
It is the heart of my new doomsday weapon.
"Guard it well, hoyle."
As the doctor orders.
Whoa.
The doomsday weapon is ancient magic?
This is big.
Uhh!
Ohh-whoa!
Jade?!
Jackie?
Stay here!
Stay here?
Tch.
When will he learn?
"All right, easy."
Easy!
That is a doomsday device?
But it is just a rock.
Daahh!
"All hands on deck, agent tag."
Ohh! Yuuh!
I am not agent tag!
Don't try to bluff me.
It doesn't <i> suit</i> you.
(Grunting)
Gahh!
The druid stone is secure.
And inform the good doctor
that we have a bonus jackpot on board.
A certain joker
who claims he <i> isn't</i> àagent tag.
"You are not what I expected,"
agent tag.
Although your disguise as a buffoon
was most convincing.
But I am not agent tag.
"I am Jackie chan,"
a researcher.
"Of course, if you were agent tag,"
you would deny it emphatically.
"No. I would claim to be agent tag,"
assuming you would not believe me.
But I would anticipate your assumption
that I would not believe you.
I would foresee your anticipating my assumption
of your not believing me.
But how could you predict I wouldn't expect your foreseeing
my anticipation of your assuming my not believing?
Hah! Answer me that.
I do not even know what you just said!
Precisely what I expected you to say...
Agent tag.
"Dr. necrosis, the druid stone has been installed."
Jackie: Ohh! It is a druid stone.
"But a druid stone is ancient, weak magic."
It is hardly a doomsday weapon.
(Chuckles)
"Ancient, yes."
But coupled with the world's largest radio telescope
"and a global satellite system,"
it is no longer weak.
Aah!
"With this remote control,"
I can target multiple beams to any square inch on earth.
"Remote control, eh?"
Time for a little channel surfing.
Aah--
yaahhh!
"Pick a card, any card."
Thank you.
Uch. Dealer calls a new game.
Huh?!
Crazy eights!
Uhh!
One of these has gotta shut this puppy off.
Putting litter in its place.
Ooh!
Jackie! The doctor's making a break for it!
"Excuse me, doctor,"
but it hurts when I go like this!
"Blast you, agent tag."
I am not--
(groan)
"Oh, never mind."
Mission log: Mission accomplished.
Not yet.
We still have to retrieve the druid stone.
And that's how I reached arecibo in time
to rescue the chans.
"That's why you're our top agent, Taggart."
Rescue the chans?
We did all the hard stuff!
"It's all right, Jade."
Let it go.
"Now, if I can finish my crossword,"
this day will truly be a success.
6 letters--
a Celtic pig goddess.
(Yawns)
Moccas.
M-o-c-c-a-s.
"Mr. chan,"
you're a genius.
Jade: Nope.
Just a researcher.
"Hey, Jackie."
Yes.
Did you ever work with Bruce Lee?
Yes.
There's a scene.
"I remember, there's a scene."
He--it was a 2 stick.
"I comes in, he just--phoom!"
"He hit me one stick, then I fall down. He just--pahh!"
He give me one stick right on here.
"I was this big with all, uh,"
bruise going on.
"After cut, he turn around,"
"just--""ohh! I'm sorry, sorry. What's your name?"""
"""My name is Jackie."" ""I'm sorry."""
"I said, ""ok, fine, fine."" You know, stunt guy."
"Suddenly the stunt coordinator,"
"""Jackie, you continue for 24 hours shooting."""
I--I know it's Bruce Lee
put in the order-- special order--
"""I--I--I want that guy."""
(Gasps) Ah!
Is it Halloween already?
"You forgot, didn't you?"
Tonight's the school play. I'm Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!
It's my big debut!
"Oh, I am sorry, Jade,"
bu the university asked uncle and me
to explore the subterranean city underneath the streets.
Uh-huh.
"No, it's true."
A recent tremor has opened a passageway
to parts of San Francisco which have been buried
since the 1906 earthquake.
"Another tremor may collapse the passageway at any moment,"
so there's not much time.
But...My play.
"Oh, I am sorry. I would rather see your play,"
but I have to do this now.
And I cannot be in 2 places at the same time.
"Uh, that's ok. I understand."
Your work is pretty important.
Huh?
Why do I need the tiger talisman?
2 jackies can be in 2 places at once.
(Stretching) Ahh!
All right! The tiger is free.
Free to be me!
Ahh!
You know how lame it is
being trapped in the same body with him?
"Oh, no! This is a big mistake!"
We should not be 2 jackies.
See what I mean?
Outta my way--pussycat!
"I am very disappointed in you, Jade."
You know that playing with magic is a no-no.
Ha! A no-no?
"Oh, no!"
Say it ain't so!
We should turn ourselves back into one Jackie right away.
Not gonna happen.
"Uncle: Jackie, open the door!"
This bag is heavy!
Uncle! He will agree with me.
No! He'll see you guys!
Open up! Uncle is not in a mood for games!
(Doorknob rattles)
Uncle: Jackie!
Where is Jackie?
I thought I heard him.
Um...He's packing.
"So, uncle, did you pick up my cape from the klean-o-Max?"
Cape? What cape?
Tch! The school play!
"If I don't have a cape, my big debut will be ruined!"
I'll be ruined! Everything will be ruined!
"Ok, ok! You are making my brain hurt."
Tell Jackie to be ready for our journey when I return.
Deal.
"Nice save, jadester."
"Our journey? Uncle's going underground, too?"
Isn't anyone gonna come see me be Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?
I would love to!
"Oh, the theater, the theater!"
Uh-oh. No way I'm showing up at school with him.
I know exactly how you feel.
Good! Come on!
Huh? But what about me?
Uncle: Jackie!
You are still not ready?
We are going to go now!
And why did you not tell me
that you already picked up Jade's cape?
I have no idea what you are talking about.
(Gasp)
A city suspended in time.
"""The bizzaritorium""?"
I have read about this place.
It is a museum of strange things from around the world.
Oof. Excuse me--
I'm free...
To be me!
Amazing. Simply amazing!
Uncle!
What was that?!
"""Spring-heel Jack."""
"Throughout history, there have been many tales of a ravenous troll"
who could leap great distances.
"The founder of this museum, Simon magus,"
must have used magic to capture the creature.
And now he is loose!
"I'm so sorry, uncle!"
"I will put the Jack back, right away!"
Wha-ha!
Yoo-hoo! Mr. spring-heel Jack!
Excuse me!
I must ask you to return to the museum.
Simon magus tried to stop me.
He gave me quite a run.
But I shall dine on his descendants
one by one by...One.
Aah!
(Sniffing)
"Are you helping magus? A relative, perhaps?"
(Sniff sniff)
No. I guess the two of you are just a pair of saps.
"Uncle, are you all right?"
Do not worry about me.
Worry about the magus family.
They are in grave danger.
And so...
Dr. Jekyll believed
that he could separate the good from the evil in man.
"(Softly) Nice read, Simone."
"With this potion,"
I will prove my scientific theories to the world!
But what if I'm wrong?
Heavens! The results could be disastrous!
"Come on, doc!"
Pick up the pace!
Turn into Mr. Hyde and terrorize the town already!
(Softly) You think you could do better?
Don't mind if I do.
(Coughs and gags)
This tastes terrible.
(Gagging)
I shouldn't have brought the tiger.
Spring-heel Jack: Ha ha ha ha ha!
(Sniffing)
"Magus, magus, wherever you are,"
spring-heel Jack will not be far.
Ah hah hah hah hah!
Do not worry!
"He's just, uh... My dog!"
"Well, that's one ugly dog."
(Sniff sniff sniff)
"Jackie, do something!"
Foolish mortals. You won't capture me...
Which is more than can be said for either of thee!
Spring-heel Jack needs a time-out.
(Audience laughing)
"Simone: Um, uh...Dr. Jekyll wanted to be good,"
but he soon lost control of himself
"to his evil side, uh, Mr. Hyde!"
This potion is wonderful!
Evil Hyde is much cooler than old goody-goody Jekyll! Ha ha ha!
(Audience laughs)
"Uh, Jade, isn't that your uncle?"
Uh...Maybe.
(Cell phone rings)
"Jade, I accidentally released an evil troll named spring-heel Jack."
Cool!
And he attacked uncle and me
and trapped us in a phone booth!
Not cool.
Spring-heel Jack is planning to destroy innocent people.
We must stop him!
Don't worry. I'll get the tiger.
Psst! Tiger!
"Uncle and the, uh, pussycat need your help."
Sorry. I'm busy with my big debut.
(Singsong) Ok... But you're gonna miss out
on some butt-kicking action all over an evil troll.
Hmm. Evil troll?
Big debut... Evil troll...
(Muttering in audience)
"I'm on my way, brother."
Stay here.
Simone... (Whispering)
"Due to some, uh, technical difficulties,"
we'll be taking a short intermission.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Yuck!
2 jackies? How long did you plan to keep this secret?
I was not born yesterday!
"Listen, unc. We don't have time for long-winded lectures."
Where's the evil troll?
"Crowd: Oh! Aah! Oh, look!"
He went that way.
2 jackies equals one big headache!
"Aah! Oh, no!"
(Whimpering)
(Sniffing) Stop your whining. No need to bawl.
You're not a magus after all.
Hee-uhh!
"Your head, it must be very thick"
if you think I'll fall from just one kick.
Catchy.
"(Crack, crack)"
"Excuse me, Mr. spring-heel Jack?"
Why don't we sit down and talk about this
like gentlemen?
Back so soon? How can it be?
Your clothes aren't even watery.
Oh! Aah!
Do you enjoy being a meanie?
I'll confess...Yes!
Miss me?
There are 2 of you?
This could be trouble.
Perhaps I'm only seeing double!
(Groans) Sorry!
Jade: Need a hand?
I thought you were at the play.
Emergency intermission.
I couldn't miss a chance to see <i> the tiger</i> àin action!
Ok.
Not ok!
Jade!
Oh! Uncle!
It's all my fault!
I snuck into section 13! I took the tiger talisman.
I hid the halves in a potted plant. I--
save the acting for your play.
Deal. So what's the plan?
Help me find a net.
Spring-heel Jack will be the winner
when I have the maguses for dinner!
(Sniffs) Almost there. No--wait!
Correction--(Sniff sniff)
A pure-blooded magus in this direction!
Wait. Wait...
Now!
No nets or chains or heavy locks
will put this Jack back in its box!
"Imprisoned for a century,"
"but now I'm free, free to be me!"
"Buddy, I know exactly how you feel."
"You do, do you? Can this be true?"
Magus sounds like a real party pooper
just like some people I know.
"I was trapped, too, but now that I'm free,"
I want to stay free to be <i> me!</i>
Hmm...You're just like me.
And it would seem that you and I should be a team!
What's in it for me?
"Fame, fortune, fun!"
Done!
This is terrible!
My dark side has gone over to... The dark side!
Spring-heel: I smell a magus to the east.
It won't be long before we feast!
Enough is enough! We need to reunite the jackies.
I will return with the tiger talisman.
(Panting)
Brother! This is not right!
You should not be helping spring-heel Jack!
Dude just wants to be free--like me!
"But he's a really bad, um, Jack-thing, and you're--"
cool?
Not anymore.
"Me, not cool?"
Cool people don't help creeps.
At least that's what all the cool people think.
"Then that's what I think, too!"
Hel-lo!
(Sniff sniff)
"The magus soon will be in sight,"
and we'll consume them bite by bite.
"Forget the <i> we,</i> Jack. You're on your own!"
"Now, now. What's this you're telling me?"
You'd rather be my enemy?
Whatever.
That was cool!
"Unsuccessful, but cool."
"Ok, bro. Let's show this troll what 2 jackies can do."
Follow those jackies!
Stay calm. Just makin' a movie.
Oh!
Driver: Oof!
Aah!
"Number one and number 2,"
I've had enough of both of you.
There's only one direction to go
to catch this jumping Jack.
Which way is that? Up.
"Go, jackies! Roll the troll!"
Oopsie. End of the line.
Aah! Aah!
"(Commotion, screams)"
(Sniffing)
"At last, - a magus is in sight,"
and I shall quench my appetite.
Aah!
Spring-heel Jack?
"My mama told me about you,"
but I thought it was just a story.
"A story, yes, but it's all true."
"I'm real, and I've come for you!"
Aah!
Spring-heel Jack is after Simone?
(Gasps) Simone magus!
Big giant duh!
Fiddle-Dee-Dee. The girl belongs to me!
Finders keepers. Losers weepers.
You're the ones who will be weeping.
I'm the one who'll do the keeping!
Uncle!
"Fee, fi, fo, fum."
Can you two really be this dumb?
Jackies! Catch!
All is fine. The magus is mine.
That's not all that's yours.
Huh?
Uh-oh.
I hope we didn't frighten you
by acting so ferocious.
Please forgive my other self.
His manners are atrocious!
This child must be made to pay
for what magus did that fateful day.
Your sweet revenge has just been soured.
I will not let her be devoured.
"No, no, no! You cannot go!"
(Clunk)
"Jackies, help!"
You! The nice one.
Tell us how to stop your darker side.
Bind his legs so he will halt.
Then hit him with a pinch of salt.
Ah! Salt I have.
"Boy, talk about convenient."
"Simone, hide in here!"
"Brother, help!"
It's up to you!
"No, we must be one, not 2."
I can assist with that.
A curse upon my lighter side.
He told the secret I would hide!
"Without him, you'd have never known"
that salt will turn me back to--
stone.
"Tiger, we must reunite."
"For once, I think you may be right."
I am me again! I am back!
"And, ohh... My aching back."
Jade: Jack is back!
"Don't forget, Jackie. You promised to come see me"
in the final performance of <i> Jekyll and Hyde</i> àtomorrow.
"Oh, Jade! I'm so sorry."
But I will be very busy writing up my research
"on the underground city,"
and I cannot be in 2 places at--
I will be there.
"Hey, Jackie,"
what kind of movies do you like to see?
"When I'm young, I like only one kind of movie--action."
But now I become familiar. I like drama.
"I like American film, Indian film, Iran, Iraq film,"
"uh, Germany film. I have to look every film."
"What is the bad things, what is the good things-- I have to know."
There's so many... Good director around the world
we just not introduced.
"If you like movie, you should watch every film--"
"cheap film, expensive film, any kind of film."
Ew!
"""One more thing."
"Go through archway, then go 30 more paces."""
Ah! The sorcerer's eye!
Just where uncle said it would be.
And the inscriptions are intact.
The museum will be very pleased to--huh?!
Oh!
Aah! Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day.
Aah!
Who are you?!
The new owner of that necklace. Give!
No! This artifact belongs in a museum.
"Heh, sorry."
"Oh, you will be."
Aah!
Aah!
Ooh!
Whew. Aah!
Are we having fun yet?
"No, we are not. Why are you doing this?"
You seem like such a nice lady.
"Been called a lot of things,"
"relic hunter, mercenary, thief,"
"but Vanessa barone, nice lady?"
Ha ha! That is a new one.
The necklace.
No. It belongs in a museum.
Ooh! - Aah!
Oh! My leg!
Oh no. I better call a doctor.
For you!
Return to pontello.
But I--you...
"Gotta admit it, sal. Venice is a nice change."
"No street crime, no weirdos, no--"
heh heh. Guide book was wrong. No subway in venice.
Gondola rides! All your favorite canals!
"The divatello, the monteleone, the pontello..."
Pontello! It is a canal.
"That's a-right. So, how many tickets you want?"
¶ La la la ¶
"know what I'm holding here, <i> paisan?</i>"
A key to all - the riches in the world.
"Uh, no speak English."
Ha ha ha!
(Gasps)
You?!
This belongs in a museum.
Whoa!
Mama Mia!
Whoa!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"I suppose you're having fun without me, Jackie."
"Fun? No, not really, Jade."
What is it you need?
I need to be where the action is.
How come you didn't take me with?
"I told you! School is too important, and--"
ha! You missed!
Missed what?
Nothing! Can we talk later?
Fine. Just hurry back.
Uncle won't let me do anything fun.
"Believe me, Jade."
There is nothing I would like more
than to return to uncle's shop.
"Hopefully, in one--wha?!"
No!
"""Uncle's shop."""
(Gasps)
Jackie! How'd you get here so soon?
You were in a taxi when I called.
"Yes, a water taxi. In Italy."
Come again?
Jackie! Did not expect you until tonight!
"You and I both, uncle."
I believe this necklace has magical powers.
Cool! Can I check it out?
"No, Jade. This necklace could be very dangerous."
Everything is very dangerous.
"Traveling to venice, digging for artifacts, wearing jewelry."
Perhaps the inscriptions from the mural will help explain.
Uncle will look into it.
"Meanwhile, you fix your niece!"
What do you mean? Ow!
Open eyes! Jade turning into a couch potato.
"Watches TV all day, all night. Young girl needs a hobby."
Hmm. I see what you mean.
(Door opens)
"Greetings, campers!"
"I'm a buttercup scout, and my troop"
is trying to raise money by selling these delicious boxes of--
cookies!
"What kind would you like, mister?"
"We have vanilla cream, chocolate mint, oatmeal raisin--"
"oh, may I... Have them all?"
You sure may! Will that be check or--
cool!
"I try to get out, but they just keep pulling me back in."
Hey! It was just getting good!
"I think I found you a hobby, Jade."
Buttercup scouts.
"This is a joke, right?"
"It's adventurous, but not dangerous."
"Oh, you look so cute!"
(Muffled whispers)
"Oh, I mean cool."
I look like an elf.
I have heard that scouting builds character.
I have also heard that scouts receive a discount on cookies.
"Jackie, I don't wanna be a buttercup scout!"
It's gonna be totally boring.
"Please, Jade. Just give it a chance."
You never know until you try.
Wanna bet?
Uncle: Jackie! Come see!
Necklace has name. The eye of Aurora.
"Ah, Aurora was an ancient Egyptian Princess said to--"
getting to that!
Aurora was ancient Egyptian Princess.
Necklace given to her by sorcerer.
Possesses magical powers of teleportation.
Travel anywhere in the blink of an eye.
But why would Princess Aurora--
getting to that! Princess was greedy.
Used necklace to travel world and steal treasure from rivals.
"Ah, no wonder Vanessa barone"
is so eager to get her hands on it.
Getting to--who?
A nice lady I met in venice.
"Where to, lady?"
Chinatown.
(Door handle being turned)
Who is there?
Warning you!
"Uncle may be thin, but he is scrappy!"
Aah!
Evil demons. Must be the necklace.
It has released a curse upon us.
Jackie!
(Snoring)
"You must learn to use a napkin, tohru."
"Aah! Go away! Demons, shoo! Shoo! Shoo!"
Hiya!
Wha?
"Chill, uncle, it's just us... Buttercup scouts."
"We were gonna build bird feeders,"
but Jade talked us into making masks.
Don't they look scary?
"Scary, no."
Uncle's heart always pounds like jackhammer!
(Sighs) Just trying to whip up a little excitement.
Why are you all here?
Don't you have a camping trip today?
"Uh-huh. Oh, gee! Didn't I tell you, Jackie?"
You're today's buttercup mom.
Me?! I can not be a buttercup mom.
I'm not even a mom.
"Actually, the rule book's pretty gray on that subject."
"A buttercup troop leader can be a mom, dad, uncle, whatever."
They even have a uniform in your size.
"Come on, uncle Jackie."
Just give it a chance. You never know until you try.
"How about it, Jackie?"
"You and me turn in our buttercup badges right now,"
"leave this whole dopey idea behind,"
head for the nearest pyramid or--
"no, Jade. This camping trip is a chance"
for you and I to have fun together. Without bad guys.
"I try to get out, but they keep pulling me back in."
And without any TV.
"Ok, buttercup scouts! All aboard!"
Hmm...
Maybe there's a way to spice up this trip after all.
(Door handle turning)
(Door opens and closes)
"No more buttercup scouts! Too late, bus left!"
"Oh, I'm not interested in transportation."
I'm looking for the eye of Aurora.
"(Gasps) Never heard of it. Thank you, come again."
"You never heard of it, huh?"
"Where's the necklace, old timer?"
"Uh, necklace gone. Jackie took it, uh, to museum."
"How long before Jackie returns from summit hill, sensei?"
"Summit hill, eh? Thanks for the tip, tiny."
Grr.
What?
And that is how you tie a bowline knot.
Who wants to try?
Scouts: Me! Pick me! I wanna try!
"All right, - Tara and Dana first."
Isn't this fun?
Scouts: Yeah!
"Gathering wood, chasing butterflies, and tying knots."
"Oh, yeah. A real party."
"Jade, the first rule of scouting is always be prepared."
You never know when knot-tying might come in handy.
I'll remember that when I join the Navy.
Maybe I should give you a special assignment.
Really? Cool! What is it?
Canteens need refilling.
You want me to fetch water?
"Yes, please."
There's a stream behind those trees.
"And please, don't wander off!"
(Scoffs) We're a mile from a mall.
"What's he think? I'm gonna make a prison break,"
hop in a getaway car and return to Siberia--huh?
Whoa! Weird!
Siberia! This thing's awesome.
"Doggies! Oh, they're so cute!"
And hungry. And <i> so</i> not dogs.
Wolves! Help!
Jackie! Answer phone!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Jackie, you are in danger."
Bad lady coming your way.
Jackie is not here.
Huh? Who this?!
What are you doing with Jackie's cell phone?
"Um, speaking with you, sensei."
Ah! Must go to summit hill! Warn Jackie!
Quickly! Find map of city!
How'd we do?
Very nice job.
"Very thorough, too."
Scouts: (Gasping)
What is it? A Bear?
"Oh, it is probably just Jade playing a prank."
Aah!
(Gasps) Vanessa barone!
Now that's a face only a mummy could love.
"The necklace, chan."
"I don't have it. Uh, scout's honor."
"If you're lying, you're going to need a lot more bandages."
A buttercup scout never lies!
Charming.
"Well, hop to it, buttercup scouts."
I'm not leaving till you find my eye of Aurora.
Honolulu! Miami! Moose world!
Come on and work all ready!
Whoa! Oof!
Oh.
Come on! Fly! Activate! Power up!
Heh. N-nice wolfies.
"I'd love to hang out and play fetch, but, see,"
I--I really gotta catch a cab
and return to uncle's shop before it gets too--
I found one!
A map?
A box of cookies.
I am still - searching for a map.
Hurry! Jackie is in big--aah!
Hey! It worked!
(Gasps) Where is Jackie?!
At the campsite.
I figured out the necklace.
"You just say the word return to,"
and whatever you say next is where you go.
Like this: Return to uncle's side.
Wha! Do not do that again!
Wait! Do that again!
Must go warn Jackie!
Bad lady headed his way!
No prob. Return to summit hill!
(Sighs) I did not have a chance to ask her for more cookies.
Ugh!
What?
"Ah, express delivery. How thoughtful."
"Well, chan, love to stay and rap,"
"but by the looks of it, you're all wrapped up."
So ta-ta!
Kia!
"Thank you for the lesson in bandage removal, miss barone."
"See, girls? Quick and painless."
Wha?!
Buttercup scouts! Too violent! Do not watch!
(Scoffs) As if!
"Sayonara, all. It's been a kick."
Return to Peru!
"I travel solo, chan. So, step off."
Both: Aah!
Return to Everest!
Both: Ooh!
M-m-mount Everest! B-bad idea!
I wanted a soft landing.
Next time pick a warm place. Like...Sahara desert!
"Uh, oh! Return to Sahara desert!"
"Brilliant! You must have been a real a-plus student, chan!"
A-minus in school.
A-plus at the dojo.
"Well, you're a complete washout as a scout leader, chan."
"Leaving those sweet, defenseless girls all alone in the woods."
(Gasps) You're right! Wha?!
Ha! Return to aculp--
"no, return to summit hill!"
Jackie! You're back!
"Yes, but so is she."
And I have the necklace.
Return to venice!
Correction. You have half the necklace.
"Come on, Jackie. Now's our chance to get her."
"Please, Jade. Stay with the others. I have a plan."
"Ok, I give up!"
No more fighting!
That's his plan?!
What's the catch?
"No catch. As you said, I am responsible"
for the safety of these girls.
"If you promise to leave,"
I will give you the other half of the necklace
and tell you where to find an amazing treasure.
I'm listening.
A small island off the coast of Chile.
"Very remote. Uh, demolition island."
"Uh, devotion island?"
"Desolation island. Nice try, chan."
Thought you could trick me into traveling
to one of the most remote spots on earth.
"No, really. I--"
I'd wager you were planning to alert the authorities
to fly in and pick me up the moment I got there.
"(Sighs) Actually, I was going to touch"
"the 2 necklace halves together, then pull my half back"
"so you would be teleported, then stranded."
"But you were too clever to say,"
"""back to desolation island."""
"Oh, return to desolation island."
(Gasps)
Get her!
Jade. The buttercups.
Jackie! Where are--
"can't talk, uncle. Must go to desolation island."
Desolation island?
Jackie!
Ooh! Where are the others?
With little miss globetrotter crook.
Scouts: Yeah! We're saved!
"Ah, you used the first aid skills I taught you."
"Actually, a little something I picked up watching TV."
<i>Robinson crusoe</i> <i>goes Hawaiian.</i>
"So how we gonna get home, buttercup mom Jackie?"
No way that'll hold us all.
Tohru?
I was hoping to purchase some more cookies.
"Once we are home, I will buy you all you can eat!"
"Hey, Jackie?"
Do you cook?
My father is a big cook.
My father's a chef but his son's the worst.
I even don't know how to cook the rice.
The people tell me it's the rice machine.
You put some rice in...
I broke the machine.
"Somebody give me a rice, already cook,"
"then I can put some oil, with a pepper..."
Only that one.
Jackie chan fried rice.
Aah!
Please! Be gentle! That Mayan calendar wheel
"is more than 1,000 years old!"
Whoa!
Aah!
Stop!
"Nice wheel! Here, wheel!"
Please!
"Excuse me, sorry!"
That should buff right out!
(Gasping)
(Gasps) Whoa!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
(Grunts)
"Captain black: Been looking everywhere for you, Jackie."
I have a high priority assignment
especially suited to your talents.
Baby-sitting?
"Not baby-sitting, body guarding,"
and this isn't just anybody.
"You'll be guarding leli, the king of tangra."
Jade: A king?
Cool. Count me in!
"Sorry, Jade. This is a diplomatic visit."
The king can't see anyone
"who doesn't have level ""a"" clearance."
"Besides, don't you have"
a book report to work on?
"Jackie, why bother reading about some president"
"from a gazillion years ago,"
"when I could be meeting a real, live king!"
"I'm sorry, Jade, but you heard captain black."
"So the king can't see anyone who isn't cleared, huh?"
It is most important to observe all formal customs
in the presence of his majesty.
"Eh, I will do my best."
Nice digs.
Undercover security.
This king must be all that.
"Jade: Whoa, the dude's <i> barely</i> that."
"May I present leli, the king of tangra."
"And shaktar, his royal tutor."
"Tangra, where a kid can be a king."
Whoa!
"Mr. chan, it is customary to perform the song of welcome."
"Oh, yes, I would love to hear it."
"It is <i> you</i> who is to sing, Mr. chan."
Me?!
Later. What I would truly like to do
is to explore the city.
"And so you shall, my king,"
but we are past due for a ceremony at city hall.
Your car awaits.
Looking out the window of a limousine
is not the sightseeing I had in mind.
A limo ride sounds good to me!
Whoa.
"These suits and ties aren't security,"
"not with those - ""have a rotten day"" tattoos."
Leli: Look! The golden gate bridge!
"Did you realize, shaktar, that it is so expansive,"
"that as soon as a crew finishes painting it,"
they must start over again?
"I was not aware of that, my king."
And there!
That is bayview stadium.
How I would love to witness a baseball game.
"Fancy hotels, luxury cars..."
"Yeah, I could get used to this."
(Crowd applauds)
"Mayor: And so, it is in the spirit"
of friendship and cooperation
that I present you with this key to our fair city.
"Thank you, San Francisco, thank you!"
You are too kind.
You really know how to make a Princess feel welcome.
(Gasps) Stop!
Jackie: Uhh!
"Oh, photographer. Heh, sorry."
Uh-oh. Jackie!
Jade?
Ooh! - Ow!
King leli! Bad men!
"Sorry, I'll give it back! Thank you!"
Uhh!
Kidnapper: Oof!
That was amazing
the way you defeated those men single-handedly!
"Hello, what am I? Invisible?"
"Oh, yeah."
And you have never seen those men before?
"A trying day, your highness."
But now it is time for your meditation period.
Then we will turn to your studies.
I have not yet taken a ride on a cable car.
I want to sightsee.
"I'm sorry, your majesty,"
that is not possible.
Those bad men are still at large.
You must remain indoors and under close watch
for the rest of your stay.
"Now, now, your highness. All is not blue."
I have the royal chefs working on a wonderful dinner.
Broccoli stew.
"Broccoli <i> souffle,</i> my king."
Yuck!
Double yuck.
"Meditation, studies, broccoli."
Why is there never any time for fun?
Uhh.
And why is this couch so lumpy?
I am not lumpy!
"We will leave you to your meditation, your majesty."
"(Sighs) Yes, yes."
"As always, you will not be disturbed"
until I return in 4 hours.
4 hours?!
I am so out of here.
Ohh!
"Soon as the coast is clear,"
I burn rubber.
Huh?
Announcer: And it's the bottom of the 8th. Prospectors are up by 3.
"Oh, king, I like your style."
Announcer: ...Swing and a miss!
Munson's having a great day on the mound.
8 ks in the last 3 innings.
And the pitch...
Strike 2!
"Full count, runners on first and second."
There's the pitch.
It's a sizzler down the left field line.
Aaron scoops it up and sends it to third.
And he's overthrown... Soy beans?
Thanks.
Both: Aah!
Who is there?!
Reveal yourself!
Wh-wh-who are you?
"I'm, uh, part of your security team."
Jackie's partner. Name's Jade.
And you can become invisible?
Can all bodyguards do that?
Only if they have one of these babies.
"Ahh, a talisman."
A <i> magic</i> talisman.
May I see?
How does it work?
You just squeeze it in your hand.
"Uh, but I don't think--"
"yep, heh, you learn fast."
"Ok, now open your hand to become visible again."
"Uh, king? Your majesty?"
Leli?
I can't believe it.
Leli...
Pulled a Jade!
"With this tea, we drink to the northern mountains"
and the Southern seas.
(Floor creaks)
"Oh, ok, king, I know you're here... Somewhere."
"Heh, mosquito."
Got it.
Cable car!
"You seen a kid about 8 years old, wearing..."
(Sigh) He'd stay invisible.
"May I buy one of your sodas, please?"
I'm so thirsty.
"Ok, hon, but they're warm."
Perfect!
Gotcha!
You are so busted!
"Uhh! Ohh! - Don't even think about it,"
and don't say a word until we get to the next stop.
(Gasps)
The king is gone!
"Game over, your highness."
"I am sorry, Jade."
Let me explain.
No! Let me explain!
"You may be Mr. big shot king,"
all I gotta do is snap my fingers
"and get whatever I want in <i> your</i> country,"
"but here, in the U.S. of a.,"
what you did is called stealing.
I only meant to borrow it
so I could escape.
"Well, even borrowing something"
that isn't yours is wrong...
And I should know.
"And what - do you mean, escape?"
You've got it made in the shade.
You have no idea what it's like being a king.
Everything is pomp and ceremony.
There's never any time for normal things.
No time for fun.
"Oh, I guess that could get kind of boring."
I suppose you will be taking me back now.
"King, you're about to go on the ""j"" line tour."
"Oh, my king, what cruel fate has befallen you?"
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Black: Jackie, we have a security problem."
"Yes, I know."
You <i> know</i> the snake is missing?
What snake?
The snake talisman. You just said you knew.
Power of invisibility... Jade.
"I'm losing you, Jackie."
"Good news, captain black."
I don't think the king has been kidnapped.
Kidnapped?!
"-What are you-- -ohh, uh, I have to go!"
I'll call you later! Bye-bye!
Is it about the boy?
I believe his majesty is safe and out exploring with my niece.
"Oh, this is wonderful news."
Not for my niece. I will find them.
I will join you.
"The boy has often spoken of places he wished to visit,"
"but first, I must inform the others."
Yes? Understood.
The boy is out in the open.
The next call will tell us where.
Then we make the grab.
Leli: Ha ha ha ha! Come look!
Look over here! Ha ha ha!
(Both laugh)
"Whoa, yippee!"
We ought to be getting back.
"Please, there is one more place I must visit."
And there's the pitch!
It's gonna be close!
The runner slides!
He's safe!
"Jackie: Yes, but <i> you</i> are in trouble."
Both: I can explain.
We have located the boy.
Bayview stadium.
The talisman.
"Heh, found out about that, too, huh?"
(Crash)
(Gasps)
Stay where you are if you want the boy to remain unharmed.
Uhh! Help!
"Jackie: No, captain black,"
no word yet from the kidnappers.
"Yes, please send a chopper."
"I want Jade and the, uh, our reptile friend"
"back at section 13, where they won't cause any more trouble."
(Beeping)
It's a ransom note.
Shaktar is to deliver the crown jewels of tangra
"to a warehouse downtown, alone,"
within one hour or we will never see the king again.
(Gasps) The crown jewels?
They are tangra's most valuable treasure!
How do you worry of mere baubles?
The boy is in danger!
I will come with you.
"But they requested me, uh, alone."
We...Must do nothing to jeopardize leli's safe return.
Exactly.
These are bad men.
We cannot be sure they will honor their word.
"Jackie, let me come, please?"
Leli's my friend.
"I know that, Jade,"
but it is too dangerous.
Captain black is on his way.
He will be picking you up by helicopter.
But Jackie...
"You will return the talisman to the vault,"
"do your homework, and go to bed."
(Scoffs)
"Please, bring our king safely home."
I will not fail his majesty.
Shaktar's hooked up with the kidnappers!
"I will see you in the morning, Jade."
"Jackie, wait!"
(Helicopter arrives)
Jade?
Time to head back to the old...
Jade?
I have brought what you asked.
Your highness! Are you all right?
"Bring the crown jewels to us,"
and then we let the boy go!
Whoa! Oof!
What sorcery is this?!
"Nice try, shaktar, but your cover is blown."
Both: Jade!
And no ice for you boys
till leli is down here with me!
"Oh, shh, Jade! No! The whole thing's a set up, Jackie!"
"What is going on here, shaktar?!"
We told you to come alone!
Come alone? Hello? What's <i> that</i> tell ya?
"Shaktar hands over the jewels, let's 'em keep leli,"
then they fax in another ransom.
What nonsense does she speak?!
I don't know.
"Jade, you have gone too far this time."
"Jackie, shaktar's got a tattoo on the back of his neck,"
just like the other bad guys.
Look for yourself.
"I'm sorry, shaktar, but may I see"
"the back of your neck, please?"
But I thought-- shaktar: You thought wrong.
"A simple plan. Pawn the crown jewels,"
"use the funds to train an elite fighting team,"
and then a palace takeover.
But why?
"Why? Because serving a king is beneath me,"
and I detest children.
"Yeah? Well, you're gonna have to get past one"
to get your mitts on the crown jewels!
"Jade, no!"
With pleasure.
Whoa!
Jade!
Aah!
Oh!
But how?
It is my mental kung fu.
I practice it while meditating.
Care to see more?
"Now, <i> that</i> was good."
Guess now you're an army of one.
As long as I have the jewels.
"Shaktar, no!"
Perhaps we should use the invisibility talisman and assist.
Jackie doesn't need any help.
"Besides, if he gets a serious workout,"
he may forget all about grounding me.
Uhh...
"Jackie chan, for heroism in the service"
"of the royal family,"
I present you with the star of tangra.
"Thank you, your highness."
Oh--
"please, do not bother."
I always thought it looked foolish.
I much prefer the high-five.
Whoa--unh!
"Thank you for everything, Jade."
You gave me a day I will never forget.
"Hey, even a king needs a little vacation."
Perhaps someday you will come visit?
We could play some ball.
You're on.
"Hey, Jackie, is it hard to be a celebrity?"
"You get a lot of things, you lost a lot of things."
"One day I sit down in a shopping mall coffee shop,"
"my friend said, ""I saw somebody wanted your autograph."""
"As soon as I sign, 2 hours. I just keep signing, keep signing."
I really don't have a private life anymore.
"The good things, really, I can get a lot of free gifts."
"Somebody give me one shoes, I say, ""can I have another hundred pair?"""
Somebody give me exercise equipment...
"""Can I have another couple sets?"""
"Then I select which high school,"
which charity--I just give.
That's the best things becoming famous.
Looks like we missed the garage sale.
"What we are looking for is most likely well-hidden, Jade."
"According to an 18th century text found in a museum,"
this palace was the last known home of the cat of Khartoum.
(Cat meows)
I think I hear it!
"It is a statue, Jade, not an actual--"
(frustrated cries)
"Oh, kitty! Got your little leg all caught in palace junk?"
(Meows)
You're welcome!
"Hungry, girl?"
"So, what's your name?"
Rrr-bbbeee rrr-bbbeee.
Ruby! Ha ha ha!
That tickles Ruby!
Odd. This tile is not as weathered as the others.
Perhaps...
Ahh!
(Agitated yowls)
"What's the matter, girl?"
Booby trap!
Mayday!
(Both coughing)
"Jade, are you--"
fine.
(Agitated yowl)
"It's ok, Ruby."
That kind of stuff happens all the time when you hang out with uncle Jackie.
(Gasps) - The cat of Khartoum!
That's it?
Looks like something you buy at a swap meet for a buck.
"Worth quite a bit more, young lady."
(Gasps) Valmont!
"Thanks ever so for finding the cat for me, chan."
Now hand it over!
No! It belongs to the museum!
"Yeah, so step off!"
We almost got pancaked looking for that thing!
"Please, let's not compare hardships."
"My men have been combing this disgusting pig sty for the past 3 days,"
searching for that kitty.
Aw! Ruined my best shirt!
"It's your <i> only</i> shirt. Oh, look at my shoes!"
"Soon as we collect the 20 large for that kitty statue, I'm gonna--"
"do put a sock in it, Finn. Get that cat!"
"Hey! Maybe you haven't heard,"
but possession is nine-tenths of the law!
Yeah? And this here's the other two-tenths!
You need to work on your math!
"Yeah? Well, my math's good enough to know"
that 3-against-1 ain't very good odds!
Spare me the gladiator scene.
Just get the merchandise!
Yes! Keep your eye on the kitty!
"Jade: Go, Jackie!"
"You hit 'em high, I'll hit 'em..."
Aah!
Low.
"Ooh, he's got drapery!"
"What you gonna do, redecorate?"
Yes! - Hey! Wha--
(meows) Jackie!
Ruby! (Yowls)
Aah!
Ahh!
Ow!
"Sharp little devil, aren't you?"
"Jade, wait here!"
Ohh!
"Valmont, this is very dangerous!"
"If we fall, we--"
how do you do that?
"It's all a matter of balance, chan."
Case in point.
Uh-oh. - Uh-oh.
Whoa--uhh!
Aah!
(Sighs)
No way.
Fantastic! I've never felt so alive!
"Something about this statue, chan."
It's good luck!
Good luck or bad magic?
"This cafe is owned by Cardiff zendo,"
"the largest collector of art objects in tangiers,"
(whispers) And known as a very shady character.
Thank you.
I suspect valmont and company
will be showing up any time now
to conduct their... Business.
"And then we take back the cat. Right, Ruby?"
(Meows)
"Jade, you cannot bring an animal into a public restaurant!"
It's not hygienic!
"Jackie, cats are very clean."
(Cell phone rings)
"Is that you, uncle?"
No! It is a magazine salesman calling you at 5:00 in morning.
Oh! Sorry. It's almost lunchtime here.
Uncle has been researching the cat of Khartoum.
"Yes, and did you discover any unusual legends or--"
"getting to that! According to legend,"
anyone who gets scratched by claw of statue--
becomes like a cat himself.
"Ooh! You already know so much,"
why you bother me?
"There is one thing I do not know, uncle."
What is the antidote?
Antidote?! Do not get scratched by claw of cat!
"I mean, how do you reverse the process?"
"Or, are you getting to that?"
No. Getting to bed. Call you back later.
(Valmont slurping)
"Dude, check it out."
Ahh!
"Want a little coffee with your cream there, big v?"
I'll give him one thing-- he's very tidy.
"I say we collect the dough for this thing pronto,"
get valmont to a doctor.
Maybe there's some kind of cure.
Don't you mean a veterinarian?
(Both stifle laughter)
"I heard that. In fact, my hearing"
has become quite acute.
There is no cure because this is not a disease.
It's a transformation...
And I rather like the new me.
"Besides, why sell to Cardiff zendo"
for a mere 20 large?
"This little kitty should go to market,"
"where we can auction it off to the highest bidder,"
or better yet...Hmm.
(Chuckles)
"Uh, you got a hairball, boss?"
An inspiration.
"Obviously, it was a scratch from tabby here"
that changed me into the glorious specimen you now see before you.
Why not use her to create others like myself?
"Stealth, cunning, and the agility of a cat!"
"Just one tiny scratch away, boys."
We'll be able to steal every treasure in the world!
We? - We?
(Chuckles)
(Meows) Tassels!
I never realized what pleasure they can give!
"So, what do you say?"
9 lifetimes of playing with yarn balls.
"Thanks, but no thanks."
Ditto.
Perhaps in time you'll come to see
how wonderful the feline life can be!
(Meows)
"Excuse me, but there's a phone call for you, monsieur."
For me?
Yes. You may take it in the back.
Perhaps uncle couldn't reach me by cell phone.
Whatever.
Ha ha ha!
Hello?
Rrarr!
Did you want to use the phone?
Uhh!
Uhh! - Rrarr!
Mayday! Mayday!
Aah! Sorry.
I really should be getting back to--whoa!
Ehh! Uhh! Ehh!
Pillow fight?
Aah!
Heh heh!
Uhh!
You are going to be in big trouble...
With the phone company.
Rrarr! - Ohh!
Thank you.
"(Chuckles) It is I who should be grateful, Mr. chan."
That display case you nearly plowed into
contains many priceless objet d'art.
You are Cardiff zendo.
So I am!
"My treasures, and soon joining them,"
the most marvelous collectible of all--
the cat of Khartoum.
But a little birdie tells me you are after the statue as well.
"Yes, and I am sure my niece has located it by now."
"If you like, I will go and find her, and--"
that won't be necessary.
Get your hands off me or I'll--I'll--
you don't even want to know!
Let her go!
"Yes, do let her go."
(Meows)
"You have just given me the most delightful idea, Mr. chan--"
one that will benefit us mutually.
What?
"Based upon the late hour, I can only surmise"
that Mr. valmont has had second thoughts about our little transaction.
Your niece will find him and fetch me the statue.
"In exchange, you get your freedom."
No! It is too dangerous!
"I'll give you, say, an hour to complete the task--"
"that is, if you ever want to see your uncle again."
"Don't worry, Jackie. I'll nab that tabby."
"Please, Jade. Be very careful of the statue's claws."
"Hey, I know my way around a cat."
(Whistles)
"You touch one hair on Jackie's head,"
you're gonna have to answer to me!
(Chuckles) Spunky.
Lock him up.
Heh.
"So, how long have you gentlemen"
been in the restaurant business?
(Cell phone rings)
Oh. I have to take this.
Nice chatting with you.
Uncle?
No. Irish sweepstakes. You win a million bucks!
"Please, uncle. I need to know about the--"
getting to that!
Old Moroccan legend of cat statue speaks of a proverb--
"""the antidote to the cat curse lies within."""
Lies within?
"Lies within <i> whom,</i> uncle?"
No idea. Sounds like fortune cookie nonsense to me.
Naptime. Good-bye.
Why'd he bring us here?
Said it was supposed to be a big score.
It's a crummy factory.
(Sniffs)
"Tcha, with a vault."
I'm starting to like the new valmont.
"He's thinking bigger, working new angles."
Sweet!
(Purrs)
"Good girl, Ruby! You found him."
Lassie's got nothing on you!
A cow factory?
"Oh, big v, that is so gross!"
"Yeah, and all that cholesterol!"
(Meowing)
Shh! They'll hear us!
"What is it, girl?"
(Slurps)
"Oh, that's nothing to worry about."
Just a big old tub of--cream! Duh!
That's the trail you were following.
Whatever. You still found valmont.
Be back in 2 shakes of a tail.
(Slurps)
(Sniffs)
(Growls)
We have us a cat burglar.
"Time to scat, cat!"
(Hisses)
Whoa!
(Yowls)
Cats hate water.
(Meows)
"Don't worry, Ruby. I won't let you get--"
"hey, let me go!"
(Yowling)
Hey! Cut it out!
Aah! - Uhh!
(Rip)
Ow! You owe me for a new pair of jeans!
"Ok, you've got your statue."
Finally! The cat of Khartoum!
Mine!
Yes! And without having to spend a penny to acquire it!
"Oh! I was not, of course, implying"
"that you're cheap, Mr. zendo."
(Nervous laugh)
You'll find your uncle in the supply closet off the hall.
"No hard feelings, my impressive young friend."
Jade!
Told you I'd find the statue.
I'm just glad you are unharmed.
Why wouldn't I be?
"Now, let's get the plaster cat back from that zendo creep!"
"You wait here, <i> please!</i>"
I suspect zendo will not surrender the cat easily.
Mmm! (Slurps) Mmm!
Got evaporated milk?
"(Gasps) Those claws, those teeth!"
Yes. The artistry is marvelous.
(Gasps)
Zendo: Valmont!
"Oh, dear. Look at the time."
I must go do that thing... That I must go do.
(Snarling) Oh!
How delightful to see you!
Yes. I was absolutely beside myself
to hear of how that awful little scamp
stole the statue before you and I had a chance
to complete our transaction.
Grrr!
"But, of course, you want your money."
"20 large, as agreed."
Count it if you like.
I just did.
"Now, then, there is one more thing I require--"
my statue!
But I paid for it!
It's mine!
No! It belongs to the museum!
"And you belong to me, rat!"
"Jade: Think again, katman-don't!"
(Hisses)
Oh! Jade!
Hah!
You--you were scratched by the statue!
"They were old jeans, anywho."
"Oh, you mean the turning-into- a-cat thing?"
I was wondering about that.
(Valmont and Jade hiss)
Whoa. Cat fight.
Forget them! Get chan!
Aah!
No! (Gasps)
Babylonian urn!
What's a babylonian urn?
Probably more than we do!
"Here, kitty kitty."
(Hissing)
(Jackie grunting)
Ow! - Uhh! - Ohh!
Uhh! - Uhh!
"When in tangiers,"
beware of flying carpets.
(Ruby meows)
(Gasps) Jade?
Wha--
(grunts)
Uhh!
(Snarls)
Whoa! A mouse!
Mouse?
Uhh!
(Groans)
"I think the words you're looking for are, ""me-ow."""
"Nobody messes with Jade, queen of the jungle cats."
(Hisses)
"Jade, you're not a jungle cat."
"I know that, Jackie. <i> Hello!</i>"
"And I know I've got to change back,"
so how do I do it?
Um...
What'd uncle say?
"He said, ""the antidote lies within."""
Sounds like fortune cookie talk to me.
"He said that, too."
"Perhaps the statue itself has some writing,"
some clue as to how to undo the curse.
We must find zendo.
(Plant rustles)
(Nervous laugh)
Where's zendo?
I don't know.
Truly I would tell you if I did.
Let me put it another way--
(hisses)
Aah! Mr. chan! Young lady!
I'm delighted to see you're all right.
I'm sure. The statue.
"Oh, yes, yes. Of course."
I always felt it belonged in a museum.
Here's chappy!
(Gasps)
(Both hiss and spit)
No. This is too dangerous to be in a museum.
Uhh!
Wha--uhh!
The antidote lies within--
within the statue itself!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Ow! Please get off!
I bruise easily!
"Well, that was different."
The cat of Khartoum! How could you?!
There's no use crying over spilled milk.
"Hey, Jackie!"
What did you study at Chinese opera?
"Beginning, the teacher really don't know what I'm good for."
"I train everything-- kicking, punch... All kind of things."
Suddenly he find out I have a very-- pretty good voice.
(Sings Italian opera)
"After that, the opera is not famous anymore."
Then I'm back to training.
"Almost whole day, nonstop training"
"until 11:00, 12:00."
"When I take off my shoes, ooh, stink."
Jackie: The museum will be very pleased
to have the golden dragon returned to Hong Kong.
How come? They've been yapping on TV
how it broke all kinds of attendance records.
"Yes, but maintaining security has been difficult."
There were at least 2 attempts to steal it.
Uh...Make that 3.
(Gasps)
Hey!
Uhh!
Quickly! Quickly!
Jackie!
No! Dah!
Looks like we hooked the wrong fish.
How do we get rid of him?
They don't call them sky <i> scrapers</i> for nothing.
Aah!
"Bad day, bad day!"
Bad day!
Uhh!
Aah!
(Whoosh)
The elevator is too slow.
Heh heh.
Uncle: 8 cantonese faces.
"12, 13, 14--"
you should have seen me!
"Rescuing the dragon, chasing off the bad guys!"
"Oh, I mean, uncle Jackie helped, too."
"Less talk, more counting,"
how many chopsticks?
"15, <i> sensei.</i>"
15? Chopsticks always come in pairs.
Count again!
"Yep! Thanks to us,"
that dragon's loaded up and sailin' to--
"Jackie: No, it's not, Jade."
The cargo ship was not a secure enough transport.
"The museum decided that with the thieves still at large,"
the golden dragon will instead travel to Hong Kong
on the last place anyone would think to look:
A cruise ship. I will accompany it.
Tsh. You lucked out.
Yes. The only problem is that the museum
has given me a 2-room suite.
I do not know what to do with all that extra space.
I'm going on a cruise! <i> Yes!</i>
Ha ha ha. All of us are going.
"Uncle, tohru--"
huh? Uncle does not cruise!
Uncle does inventory!
"Uncle, when was the last time"
you took a real vacation?
Let me see.
(Abacus clicking)
"3, 4, carry the one."
"Never! So, why start now?"
Because it'll be wicked fun!
Come on. <i> Please?</i>
Heh...
"Ay, uh..."
Eeh. Brown eyes get uncle every time.
Fine. I'll go.
Yes!
I will stay here.
"Tohru, hello?"
"Swimming pools, whale watching."
All the shrimp you can eat.
"Ok, strike that. All the <i> pizza</i> you can eat?"
I cannot travel on a ship.
Tsh. Knew I shouldn't have taken you to see <i> Titanic.</i>
"That was just a movie, tohru."
"It's not that, Jade."
I get seasick.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh. You're serious.
"Hey, there's medicine you can take for that."
I have tried.
Nothing helps.
"Well, guess what."
I have a guaranteed cure for seasickness.
You do?
"Meet you back at section 13, Jackie."
Gotta go pack!
12 inches thick
and absolutely state of the art.
Most banks don't have a vault this secure.
I'm sure it is more security than is necessary.
"Midnight rollerblading, video arcade, dessert 24-7."
Cruising is so cool.
Ahh! Waste of time.
Will not even be able to get a good cup of tea.
Woman: He drinks tea?
Thought Billy goats only eat tin cans.
Ay ah!
Fat dragon locked in vault!
"Tohru, what's your mom--"
"um, Jackie said it would be all right"
to have her join us.
"Where are you going, uncle?"
To lifeboat! Row back to shore!
Good! I have better things to do
than hang around with junk-seller.
"I visit with my boy, relax,"
play a little mahjong.
You play mahjong?
No. I win at mahjong.
5-time all-Kyoto finalist.
Hong king community center champion 1955.
Beat you with one hand tied behind back.
Ha! Big talker.
How about you put your tiles where your mouth is.
"Jade: Where have you been, tohru?"
You totally missed dinner
and the make-your-own- sundae bar.
"They had everything. Whipped cream, nuts--"
(groans)
"I think tohru has still not found his sea legs, Jade."
"You said you had a cure for seasickness, Jade."
Oh?
Uh-huh. I do.
"It's, uh... Hypnotism!"
Read a book about it.
Ah. This I would like to see.
"We kind of need privacy, Jackie."
"Now, just watch my hand."
(Gasps) The horse talisman.
The healer.
My little pony's guaranteed to cure what ails you.
But you are forbidden to remove the talismans from section 13.
"Ok, if that's the way you feel."
Thought so.
Well?
(Stomach growls)
Ahh. Do you think there is any orange sherbet left?
Ha! I win again.
"Ah, you cheat again."
"Every time I sneeze, you move a tile."
"You sneeze, all the tiles move."
Bird beak nose should have its own zip code!
Grrr!
Hmm. 7 through zero upgrade. It's got a titanium shell.
Can you crack it?
Only one way to find out.
(Snoring)
(Loud snoring)
Huh? Who's sawing?
"What are you doing out here, tohru?"
Could not sleep.
I know what you mean. Your mom snores like a lawn mower.
I tossed my crackers.
"Huh? Oh, you mean you tossed your cookies."
Guess the cure's like medicine.
Gotta keep taking it.
I'll get the talisman.
"Talisman? Where is it, Jade?"
(Footsteps)
I will be checking on the dragon after breakfast.
"If I do not find the talisman in the vault,"
you will be spending the rest of the cruise
inside your room.
Hyuh! Yah! Huhh!
Status.
(Sighs) Impervious.
Unh...Er...Uhh!
"""How many times have I told you"
"the talismans are dangerous?"""
Tsh. Tohru losing his lunch is dangerous.
"Man: I can attempt a circuitry bypass,"
but as soon as a crew member
"accesses - the ship's computer,"
he'll know we're online.
Then I guess we better
go with our contingency plan.
"Basil, butch..."
We're taking over the ship.
"Unh...Come on, come on."
Unh...Err...Uhh!
Butch...
"Hmm. - You lose at mahjong, Chinese checkers."
Billy goat care to try gin rummy?
I prefer a game of skill. Shuffleboard.
"Uh, how about relaxing by the pool?"
Quiet! - Quiet!
(Tohru groans)
"Tohru, how is my baby boy feeling today?"
"A little better, mommy."
Come. A walk will do you good.
Where are we walking to?
Breakfast. Ocean air always gives me a big appetite.
"Eggs, bacon, biscuits."
Tohru?
(Groans)
"P.A.: Attention, all passengers."
This is your captain.
Please assemble in the ballroom
for a mandatory safety presentation.
Heh! Not yet have morning tea!
(People talking)
Ha! What kind of ship they running?
"Captain calls meeting, no captain here!"
Something is wrong.
"Afraid the captain and crew are indisposed, folks."
The ship is now under my command.
What? Huh?
(All gasp)
Laser cage.
I suspect these are the same men
as from the helicopter.
They are after the dragon.
Good. They can have her.
Funny man won't be so funny
when I whoop you at shuffleboard!
"Excuse me, tohru! Thank you!"
One of the rabbits jumped his cage.
Maori fighting stick!
Drum stick! Heh.
Wha--?!
Aah! Uhh!
Oh!
Wah! Unh!
Ohh...
Unh! Ohh...
"(Feebly) Thank you, tohru."
I am going to be sick.
Aah!
How much longer?
Access code variables are infinitely exponential.
In English.
Working on it.
I win. Again.
(Paper crumpling)
"Heh! That's because you have ""xs."""
"""Xs"" always win!"
All will be settled on shuffleboard court!
"Oh, Jackie, would you please stop pacing?"
Sorry. I am very worried about Jade.
These are dangerous men.
"Jade: Don't worry, uncle Jackie."
I got it all covered.
Uhh! Jade!
"Ok, here's the plan."
You distract him. I'll do my famous flying drop kick.
"That will-- - no, Jade."
I have a better plan.
Find the communications room and signal an s.O.S.
But-- - and please hurry!
"Yeah, that's always <i>my</i> favorite part of the movie--"
when the hero makes a phone call.
"Uh, hello? Mayday! Mayday!"
Can someone connect me to section 13?
It's a top secret organization.
"Uh, they're probably not listed."
"On second thought, just get me the coast guard."
Someone's on the ship-to-shore.
Jade: The ship has been taken over by a--
a bunch of thieving pirates!
What is your location?
<i>Prince Arnold</i> cruise ship.
"And we're, like, a few hundred miles from San Francisco."
"No, what is <i> your</i> location? Where are <i> you</i> on the ship?"
"Well, I'm in the radio room,"
but what's that got to do with--
uh-oh.
(Crumpling)
"Uh, you're breaking up. Over and out!"
Butch...
Right.
Got us a wild rabbit.
I'll hunt her down.
Jade.
(Grumbling)
She's in the air ducts.
Too tight for butch.
I have a solution.
"Nice plan, Jackie."
"This time, we do it my way."
A little surprise attack and--wha--?
"Hey, who turned on the air conditioning?"
Whoa! Whoa! Unh!
"Uh, which way to the pool?"
Got her.
"Good. If anyone actually intercepted that ship-to-shore,"
we'll be crawling with coast guard.
Another 20 minutes and--
new plan. We blow the vault.
"We discussed this, giles. Too risky."
If a fire breaks out or we breach the hull--
just do it!
Ow!
Hey! Come back here!
30 seconds.
(Gasps)
"Slippery little eel, ain't ya?"
"Well, maybe it'd be best to return you to the water."
"Uh, see this? It has magic powers, and--"
and it'll blast you if I say the magic words!
Yeah. Right.
(Boom)
Aah!
(Water gushing)
I warned you.
"The vault's open, isn't it?"
"Yes, and so is a piece of the hull."
No more magic! Please?
What's with all the sirens?
The ship is sinking!
The passengers... In the ballroom!
I'm all over it.
Jade to the rescue!
(All gasp)
"Everyone, calmly to the lifeboats."
(Everyone screaming)
There will not be enough time to evacuate.
"The talisman, Jade--"
perhaps we can use it to heal the ship.
"Ok, but you're breaking your rule about--"
Jade! - All right!
"Uh, uh, I think I lost it,"
"uh, in the galley!"
I will find it!
Please climb into a lifeboat with the others!
(Passengers arguing)
"We're near capacity, captain!"
The boats can and will accommodate every passenger
and crew member.
But we never really had anyone <i> his</i> size.
That boat? Bobbing up and down? Ohh.
I will stay here.
"If my baby not going, I not going!"
Bah! Take the Billy goat!
Ha! Nice try.
Uncle not leave ship until whip you at shuffleboard!
Take Jade. Where is she?
Jackie'll never find that talisman
without my eagle eyes.
The golden dragon!
You don't really think you're going to stop us?
No. Take the artifact.
I only want to protect the ship
and the people aboard it.
I don't believe you.
"Take care of him, boys."
We'll meet you topside.
Uhh! What about butch and basil?
"They snooze, they lose."
Hyuh!
Aah! Huh!
"Uhh! Oh, gah!"
Wah!
Aha?
Jade: Don't make me use this.
Uhh! Get out of here before she blows us up!
Trust me.
Blow us up?
It's a long story.
Let us hope this works.
(All gasp)
Look at that!
Ohh...
I don't believe it.
(Retches)
Ahh! Finally we can relax
and enjoy the cruise.
Where is tohru?
You got me. Haven't seen him
since your big lecture about how
"""the talisman is not to leave the vault."""
It's nice to see those 2
actually enjoying each other's company.
"Ah, junk monger, weak as scrawny chicken. Gah!"
Toothless old bat got nothing! Uhh...
"Hey, Jackie..."
Yes?
What do you do on rainy days?
"Actually, I will drive my car,"
"especially at night, middle of the night,"
"like at 3:00, 4:00. Just by myself."
I let the rain...
"Then I will stop, you know, somewhere"
"around, beside the highway."
Have a sun roof with all the glass is on the top.
I just listen to music. Listen to rain.
"Really, really, really relaxing."
Jade: Help!
"Jackie, can't hang on!"
Need...Food.
"You are not starving to death, Jade."
You could have some of uncle's mung beans.
I'll never be <i> that</i> hungry.
Unh! Tohru went to get dinner forever ago.
"What, did he get attacked by ninjas or something?"
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
(Gasps)
(Chanting)
(Tohru roars)
Ayah!
"Tohru, no! He is a holy man!"
(Whimpers)
Heh. Welcome to uncle's rare finds.
Kindly forgive the brutish behavior of my apprentice.
He offers you his meal as an apology.
(Slurping)
"Ooh, we would never eat <i> his</i> food."
You do not like mushu?
We monks of the Ben shui order
have followed signs and omens
to this place in search of the chosen one.
Haven't seen him. You?
Wha... - Hey!
"Accept this offering, o chosen one."
But he can't be your leader.
He's our tohru.
The chosen one has lived a thousand lifetimes.
"When one life has run its course,"
the chosen one's life energy--his chi--
returns in a new vessel.
That's why tohru's so big.
All that extra chi.
Why did you not tell me you were a leader of holy men?
I did not know.
No doubt it is due to my good influence.
Come. We must journey
"to our temple in Bhutan,"
where the high mystic
will awaken your chi.
You're leaving now?
The chosen one's chi
is vulnerable while it sleeps.
If the dark forces were to destroy him now--
destroy?
Let 'em try.
Big t can take care of himself.
"(All gasp) Oh, no, no, no."
"The chosen one is a being of peace,"
not of war.
It is foretold that a champion
will come forward to defend him.
Huh?
"Uh, so, uh,"
what sort of dark forces are we talking about?
The Ben shui have located the chosen one.
"I, tao LAN wong, cannot allow"
"his chi to be awakened,"
for evil must prevail.
Dark chi must reign!
Gon! Chui! Ran!
Seek out the chosen one and annihilate him!
All: Ohh!
"The chosen one is a river of enlightenment,"
not a beast of burden.
Ahh.
The champion will serve.
Huh? Unh! Uhh! Oof!
"Behold, chosen one... - But--"
your sacred garments.
Silk. Very chic.
I am losing my assistant shopkeeper.
Jackie will just have to help more around the shop.
"Come, you will both serve - the chosen one well."
"Uh, serve?"
"Really, this is not necessary."
Ohh! The chosen one's glory
"must be celebrated, not concealed."
Tch! So those dark forces can find him?
Unh! Ohh! Argh!
"Rise, champion."
Our temple is still many miles away.
(Yawns)
Ohh! The chosen one requires rest.
We will stop for the night.
Grr.
Uncle is too old for this.
Tch! I'm too old for this.
Let's just try to make the best of--oh!
"When the chosen one sleeps well,"
everyone is rested.
(All grumbling)
(Snoring and wheezing)
Ohh.
"Ooh...Tohru, uncle has the willies."
Willies?
Dark chi must be near.
How near?
Ohh!
Whoa! Freaky eyes.
A dark chi warrior!
Chi master fung warned me of such dark entities.
Uh-uh-uh!
The chosen one is a being of peace.
Ohh.
Pillow fight--unh!
You are too young to wage battle
with the forces of darkness!
Aww!
One more thing...
Both warrior and weapon share the same dark chi.
They function as one.
How nice for them.
"Gone! Jackie, you smoked him!"
This was but a test.
"And Jackie aced it, right?"
"Hmm, let us say"
more extreme challenges lie ahead.
Tohru: Not anymore.
We are going home.
I do not want anyone to be hurt
on my behalf.
Ohh! Such selflessness
in the face of danger!
There can be no doubt.
He <i> is</i> the chosen one!
Auughh.
Jade: Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
Patience.
"Before the chosen one reaches our temple,"
he must greet his worshippers.
Worshippers?
Man: It's the chosen one!
"Woman: Look, it's him!"
(All calling out)
W-what do they want?
To bask in your glory.
"Villagers, chanting: Chosen one!"
Chosen one!
Chosen one!
Ohh! Where did he go?
Ohh! The chosen one has vanished!
Tohru!
Ow!
You are a lousy champion!
You let the chosen one out of your sight!
We must find him.
Who knows - what the dark forces intend to do?
Tohru? Tohruuu!
"Big t, where are you?"
"Dark forces, huh?"
Ahem!
"(Imitating monk) The chosen one is a cleanser of souls,"
not a washer of dishes.
(Sighs) But I do not <i> want</i> to be the chosen one.
Tch! Why not? You have your own personal champion
and servants who wait on you hand and foot.
"I am not accustomed to such treatment, Jade."
"I enjoy serving people,"
especially those I like.
"Well, maybe washing dishes"
isn't the only way to help.
Did you see how happy you made those villagers?
"The chosen one serves, too,"
in a...Different kind of way.
"Ohh, perhaps you are right."
"Good, 'cause you missed a spot."
You are <i> so</i> fired.
Jackie? Uncle? I've found--
trouble.
Dark chi guy brought some freaky-eyed friends.
Let's take 'em.
But the chosen one is not allowed to fight.
Eh! Nobody's lookin'.
Ohh!
Wah!
Bah!
Hyah!
You are still too young!
Ohh...
Chopped salad.
You're fixing a snack?
How can uncle cast a chi spell
without the ingredients?
"Ooh, you better get cooking!"
Huh!
Daaaah!
Huh?
(Both chanting)
Ohh.
"We really smoked 'em this time. Right, uncle?"
My disappearing spell is only temporary.
Our temple is near.
The chosen one will be safe
once the high mystic awakens his chi.
"So, a champion is not enough for the chosen one."
He brings his own chi wizard as well.
Then it will take a chi wizard
to beat a chi wizard.
"Do not worry, champion."
Good chi protects our temple.
The dark entities cannot enter from outside.
"Greetings, friend."
Are you prepared to accept your destiny?
(Chanting) Chosen one. Chosen one.
I am.
Then let us begin the awakening ceremony.
Ah...Mmm...
"When you awaken from this trance,"
your chi will awaken as well.
You will remember your thousand lifetimes
and lead us once again.
(Chanting)
(All chanting)
(Chanting)
"Ooh, the willies."
(Gasps)
The dark warriors!
But I thought the dark entities
could not enter from outside.
A dark chi trick.
They were summoned from <i> within</i> the temple.
"If the dark ones destroy the vessel,"
the chosen one's chi will be lost forever!
(Gasps) And we'll lose tohru forever.
Destroy the chosen one!
Unh! Ha! Unh! Ha!
"Step aside, wizard!"
Your tepid spells cannot stop me.
Be warned.
I was a student of chi master fung.
"And I am tao LAN wong,"
the dark master who defeated fung.
(Gasps) You will pay for that!
(Chants)
Hyah! Nyuh! Uhh!
Mine!
Yours.
(All chant)
Ooh...
How did you do that?
Master fung taught me well.
How long is this ritual?!
"This walking stick belonged to the previous chosen one,"
the yak Shepherd chop yep. It will help you.
How?
It is full of his good chi.
Use your chi to control it.
How?!
Heh. I have a stick.
Doh! Uhh! Oh! Ooh!
A very good stick.
If it works for them...
Yes!
No! Ohh!
(Gasps)
Stop!
Whoa.
Waah! Hyah!
Cool.
There goes my chi.
No! Leave him alone!
(Chanting)
Huh?
No.
(Grunts)
"The awakening is complete, great leader."
Your memories have been restored.
They have?
You do not remember your thousand lifetimes?
Mm-mmm.
Not even your once trusty walking stick
or your most favorite yak?
Mmm...I am sorry.
No.
He is not the chosen one.
I am not?
I am not!
Guess what that means?
(Tohru growls)
Rahhrrrr!
"When the true chosen one is found,"
I shall return.
That is what you think!
Ow!
Yaaah!
"Go, uncle."
Now your temple is safe.
Tao long and his dark warriors
may not enter again.
Duh! Grr...
Gyuh...Gyuh!
I insist.
"Um, my apologies about the mix-up."
The chosen one will be found
when the time is right.
"Go in peace, friend."
"Could it be that you found the right place,"
but the wrong vessel?
Did you see how the girl child
wielded the chosen one's walking stick?
It is as if her chi and his were one.
Perhaps we should see if she remembers the yak.
"Hey, Jackie."
Yes?
Are the characters in the show
based on people you know?
"I think, yes."
"When I look at the uncle,"
"the way he speak, ""ooh, ooh, ooh."""
"Half like my father, half like my manager."
"Jade, yes. So many young girls like the niece."
"Of course, not the bad guy. The shadowkhan."
He's got--that's-- that's--you make somebody.
Tohru?
One of my stunt guys.
"The character of myself, sometimes very comedy,"
sometimes very serious.
That's me.
"""X"" marks the spot..."
The spot where Angus mckutcheon finally gets his...
The legendary treasure of greenbeard the pirate.
Haggis!
"Aye, that's me."
Take us in.
20 years! 20 years I've searched.
"And now that I've found it,"
I'll be filthy rich!
Unh! Ahoy?
Get your mitts off my Booty!
"Uh, excuse me?"
(Growls)
Hello. My name is Jackie.
The only one gettin' rich off this treasure is mckutcheon!
What about haggis?
"Ah, shut it!"
"I'm sorry, but this find belongs to the museum."
"Your name is ""the museum""?"
"Uh, no, the historical museum of San Francisco."
"I'm donating greenbeard's treasure, not getting rich."
"Ah, shut it!"
"And, uh, since I did find it first..."
Would you like these instead?
Haggis! Sic!
(Yelling)
"I'll cleave you like an aberdeen ham, you wee piglet!"
Unh! Uhh!
(Laughs evilly)
Mine! All--
sorry.
How did they get there?
Let me be perfectly clear.
I don't want the gloves!
Unh! Uhh!
(Groaning)
Whoa!
I knew you were a pushover.
Waah!
(Coughing)
Haggis! Get him!
"Haggis: Oh, haggis has him."
(Gasps)
Haggis! No!
Haggis!
I promise to call the coast guard. Bye-bye.
"Curator: Excellent work, Jackie."
"""The glorious gold of greenbeard's treasure"""
will be my most elegant exhibit ever.
I'm glad you're so--huh?
How did they get there?
"Well, they shan't remain there, I can tell you."
"My exhibit is greenbeard's treasure,"
not greenbeard's gloves.
Hmm.
Jade: Uncle!
Tohru! Hello?!
The game never ends if nobody moves.
"How can tohru contemplate a move with you yelling, Jade?"
"I thought it was your move, sensei."
Ugh.
Jackie!
Unh!
Are these from greenbeard's ship?
Can I keep 'em? Please?!
I've been reading all about greenbeard.
You've been reading? For pleasure?
Tch. Not like there's anything else to do around here.
"""The meanest pirate of them all,"
"greenbeard swore he would keep stealing forever,"
"even after he died."""
Arr! How cool was he?
"There is nothing cool about stealing, Jade."
(Whiny) Ohh.
Crime does not pay.
If captain black had not pulled strings
"after I left the dark hand,"
I would be in prison right now.
"Instead, he lives under the supervision of his parole officer."
So tohru is free-- ai-yah--
to lose as many games of mah-jongg as he likes!
(Sighs)
"Thank you, Jade."
"No. Thank you, Jackie."
Uncle can sell these.
(Snoring)
(Knock on door)
Uncle: Welcome to uncle's rare finds.
How may I help you?
Had a break-in on this block last night.
We're checking alibis on all prior <i> offenders</i> in the area.
Uncle: Tohru was here all night.
He is good now. You may go.
(Gasps)
Officer: You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
"Tohru, what have you done?"
"Tohru: Please believe me, sensei."
I did not--
(chanting chi spell)
"So, do you think-- could you please"
pull a few more strings?
"I want to, Jackie, but my hands are tied this time."
I really thought tohru had left his past behind.
So did I.
But the sad truth is some people never change.
"Well, thank you, anyway, captain black."
Wait! Call him back!
What if tohru was framed?!
There were no evil spirits in tohru's body.
If the forces of darkness
"did not reawaken his criminal side,"
I am to blame.
I did not provide enough discipline!
We can't give up yet.
"Tohru's innocent until proven guilty, right?"
(Groans)
"We are all upset about tohru, uncle."
Of course I am upset!
Tohru had work to do!
Now you must move all these antiques!
(Gulps)
(Groans)
(Sighs) Tohru never used to groan like that.
Ow! What was that for?
Discipline!
I was too soft on my old shopkeeper and look what happened.
He became a criminal!
(Sighs)
(Groans)
Ohh. Finished.
Tohru never used to get sore.
One more thing...
Lick this envelope.
(Yawns)
"It's late, uncle. Maybe we should just spend the night."
It is very quiet without tohru.
"So, keep it down! Uncle needs his rest."
(Snoring)
"Uncle, I think this bathtub has spiders in it."
(Moaning)
Thank you.
Daah!
Diamonds?!
The gloves!
Stop! Thief!
Waah!
I told you to keep it down!
Uncle! The gloves! They're alive!
"You are dreaming, Jackie."
Go back to--
bwaah!
Ai-yah!
(Murmuring)
Hold still!
(Ticklish laughter)
Ohh! Stop!
Huh?
Ugh!
Daah!
Now can I keep 'em?
"Greenbeard's life of crime may be over,"
but his gloves are still stealing.
"Tohru <i> was</i> framed, sort of."
We must tell the police.
Release tohru now!
Aren't you the evil-spirits guy?
Tohru did not steal. The gloves are to blame.
Jackie!
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Get up! You do not fool uncle!
"Now, why don't you folks just get some rest, and we--"
gloves are evil! Tohru is innocent! End of discussion!
"Uncle, please don't yell at the nice policeman."
Jackie's right. Let's just take the gloves and...
(Gasps)
(Tohru struggles)
No! I do not want to...
What part of evil gloves do you not understand?
Tohru is innocent!
(Gasps)
One more thing--
we'll be right back.
Uncle: Aiy!
Tohru broke out of prison? He is not innocent now!
Jackie: The museum!
He must be after the treasure!
"Tohru's not, but the magic mittens on his hands are."
Keep the police busy.
We can't let them see tohru.
"Forgive my earlier rudeness, sergeant."
I wish to apologize by telling you my life story.
Doughnuts!
"Whoa, hey!"
Don't all crowd around the window.
That's bad for digestion.
Tohru!
Jackie! I cannot control my...
"And in the summertime, mother would cook big bowls of mung beans."
Heads up! There you go! Who wants sprinkles?
Don't come to the doughnuts.
The doughnuts will come to you.
"Uh-oh! Um, stay where you are! I'll go get more!"
We have to--gaah-- remove your gloves from your hands!
Sorry.
Bwaah!
Most sorry.
Ha ha! Huh?
Uh-oh.
Why hasn't the alarm gone off?
Perhaps they disabled it.
"Steal greenbeard's loot from mckutcheon, will they?"
"Well, mckutcheon's stealing it back!"
The museum.
"I know where we are, you daft..."
You!
Hello again.
You know them?
Whoa! Who's the old lady with the mustache?
Haggis! Sic!
(Babbling)
Cool.
Nobody grabs my Booty twice!
You're goin' extinct!
Unh! - Bwaah!
Jackie!
(Babbling)
Aah! Me kilt!
Ohh! Eeh!
Oogah boogah!
"That's caveman for ""we win."""
Whoa! Whoa!
"Uh, guys?"
Stop!
I don't think the gloves are listening.
Maybe they'll listen to this!
"Oh, gloves!"
I'm stealing your Jewel.
Both: Whoa!
Come and catch me!
"Jade, what are you..."
You want it? Fetch!
"Good-bye, sticky fingers."
"Yes, but now this will be even more difficult to explain."
Wait! I have not told you about fourth grade.
"Please, just..."
Hey! Freeze!
(Whistles)
Heh. It was the gloves?
Guess we'll have to kiss your Booty good-bye.
Angus: Shut it!
And my people were part of an undercover sting operation
to catch these notorious modern-day pirates.
Sorry about the mix-up. Never would've guessed you guys were agents.
Of course you're all free to go.
(Sighs)
Thank you all for helping to clear my name.
We shall see how thankful you are
after uncle trounces you in another game of mah-jongg!
Hey! Uncle's frowning again. That means he's happy.
Got it!
"And section 13 did locate the gloves, right?"
Huh?
"Hey, Jackie."
Have you ever been bullied?
"When I very, very young, yes."
"When I don't like being bullied,"
I go to beat somebody.
"Ok, what happen? I win."
"But one day, I'm gonna lose."
"After that, after I get hurt,"
"somebody bullied me, I just, ""yes."""
Why? Because this guy get beaten by somebody one day.
There's so many tough guy in the world.
They get in trouble some day.
Don't try to be a tough guy.
"Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome"
the dark hand!
(Hard rock playing)
"Hello, Cleveland!"
Get down! Get funky!
It's the seventies!
(Helicopter approaching)
(Feedback echoes)
We're not even doing anything wrong.
You were off-key.
Chan!
(Gasping)
I gotta get away from chan.
I <i> will</i> get away from chan.
No more dark hand means no more chan.
I'll start my own crime syndicate.
Look out world! Finn's goin' solo!
(Crickets chirping)
"Uh, first thing in the morning."
Is this late huang dynasty or early ming?
Um... It is from China.
(Sighs)
Ow! - You are a terrible salesman!
You must know the merchandise!
"Uncle's right, tohru."
For example...
This lovely lamp is from the junk dynasty.
"You are not helping, Jade."
Uncle: You need sales training!
Jackie will assist.
I will?
And Jade will mind the store.
Cool!
Do I get paid?
"Sell something, and we will talk."
Let the sell-a-thon begin!
Welcome to uncle's rare--
take it! It's yours.
"Oh, no, you don't!"
I'm not taking this thing.
Unless you buy something.
Whew.
"Uh, how much?"
500 bucks?
Deal.
Whoo hoo! Yeah! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
What's <i> he</i> so happy about?
"Uh, note the hand-painted details"
"and, um, ahem, duck shape."
How nice. I will take 2.
Ai-yah!
"Tohru, you must mention its age,"
"and, Jackie, I did not believe your performance"
for a second.
"Jade: Oh, uncle!"
Somebody made a sale.
Ohh! - Jade!
(Sighs)
But wait! I also made an acquisition.
(Gasps)
Uncle: Ai-yah!
(Echoing) Ai-yah!
Ai-yah!
Infamous emerald of killarney.
Feared throughout the world.
"Uh, feared?"
"That stone carries an Irish curse,"
bringing endless bad luck to whomever possesses it.
"Ohh, Jade, you are cursed!"
Really? I don't feel cur-- (Gasps)
I'm cursed!
"One accident does not make a curse, Jade."
Uncle is just being superstitious--
aah!
"I'm not saying I believe in this curse,"
but perhaps you should give me that.
Just in case.
Did you see--
(cell phone rings)
Hello?
I'm bankrupt?! How is that possible?
(Gasps)
(Softly) The curse.
Ohh!
(Sighs) Next.
Grrrr!
Oh! Ha ha ha.
Next.
(Sighs)
How can I launch my solo career
without decent henchmen?
Chow: You're still lookin' for muscle?
'Cause we're lookin' for work.
"After you quit, we told valmont"
"he'd better give us raises, or we'd quit, too!"
And now you guys want to work for me?
"That is so c-- I mean, that's cool."
"So, what's the job, Finn?"
"Uh, call me boss."
There's a certain priceless gem I've been tracking...
And I've just met somebody
who knows where to find it.
(Muffled) Help!
Is this really necessary?
"You possess the emerald now,"
so you possess the curse!
We must make certain nothing bad happens to you.
"Uncle, this <i> is</i> something bad."
"You cannot pass your troubles to someone else, Jackie."
You must Bear the curse alone until I am able to break it!
"I understand, uncle."
But...
(Grunts)
I...Maxed out my library card.
Everything they got on Irish legends.
<i>Antique selling</i> <i>for dummies?</i>
"Ah, that one is mine."
Where's Jackie?
Ha-chaa!
The curse is transferred
when the emerald changes hands.
Only if the exchange is made willingly.
I had to agree to take it.
That's why - Mr. jitters was so eager to make a deal.
One more thing.
The curse may only be broken
by returning the emerald to Ireland
to the tomb from which it was stolen.
(Knocking on cupboard door)
Jackie: Can I come out now?
Jade: I got you into this.
At least let me help get you out.
"Besides, you can't go to Ireland by yourself."
You're cursed.
"I can handle - a little bad luck, Jade."
Uncle: Not without uncle's lucky charms.
Garlic. Good for digestion and for luck.
One more thing--
rabbit's feet.
They work better when they are still on the rabbit.
"And keep these with you at all times, or else."
Or else what?
The rabbit will get hungry!
"Ahh. So far, so good."
Taxi!
Oh! Hey!
"Uh, stop! Wait!"
"Here, bunny, bunny."
Aah! Oh!
"Hey, look out!"
"Watch it, fella! Sorry!"
Unh.
Aah!
Aah!
Unh.
"Oh, if I don't break this curse,"
it may break--
uh...
"The airport, please."
Th-that's where I unloaded the emerald.
Chan?! He has the stone?
Of all the rotten luck!
Maybe we should track down
a different emerald.
"Yo, I'm the boss,"
and I say we're gettin' <i> this</i> emerald.
"Hey, maybe chan was too much"
"for the dark hand,"
but we are the Finn experience.
"Look, trust me, you don't want that thing."
There's an Irish curse on it.
There is?
"Yeah, what, the curse of killarney?"
"Hey, I'm Irish, and every Irish dude"
knows that curse is a bunch of blarney.
Let's nail him!
"Hey, who's the boss here?"
Let's nail him!
Man: Look out!
No bad luck. No bad luck.
No bad luck. No bad luck.
No--unh.
Could you please raise your--
no.
Ahh.
Ireland. I made it in one piece.
Huh?
Jade?
"Uncle may go for garlic and rabbits,"
but we both know
I'm your <i> real</i> good luck charm.
"Jade, you are going back right now--ow!"
Top o' the morning to ya.
You're going back--ow!
You're--ow!
Why does everyone keep doing that?
'Cause this is Ireland.
Jade: You're not wearing green...
And it's kind of St. Patrick's day.
Jackie: Ow!
I should have--ow--
known the airline would--ow--
lose my luggage--ow!
"Come on, let's get you some green."
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Uncle: Jackie,"
I have been doing more research.
Tohru is performing
an Irish good luck spell for you.
Is it working?
I don't--ow-- think so.
"You call that an Irish jig, tohru?"
That spell says you must riverdance.
"One more thing-- to avoid bad luck,"
always wear a belt.
"Uncle: Beware of men named Seamus,"
and never - stand with your back
to an open door.
Are you making these up?
Do you want uncle's help or not?!
(Gasps) Open door.
(Gasps) The dark hand?!
Not anymore.
We are Finn and the revolution.
I thought we were the Finn experience.
"Ah, I'm still playing around with names."
Now give me the stone.
The emerald?
"Believe me, you do not want it."
It's--
"cursed? Nice try, chan."
"Now, hand it over."
"Ok, Jackie,"
this should-- uh-oh.
"Jade, stay here."
(Grunts)
Uncle was right about the belt.
I need those!
Then give me the emerald.
You'll just sell it
and pass the curse to someone else.
There is no curse.
Aah!
Hello.
Oops.
Finn: There he is!
(Jeering and laughing)
"Why, lookee there, Seamus."
Seamus?
"Why, that fella's not wearin' any pants, Seamus."
"Aye, Seamus,"
"and he's not wearin' any green, neither."
"No one escapes from Finn, wind, and fire."
Unh.
Eww.
Lose something?
2 somethings.
Finn took the emerald.
Good! Now the curse is <i> his</i> problem.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
Uncle: - One more thing--
watch out for pickpockets.
The curse is transferred
"when the emerald is exchanged willingly,"
but if the gem is stolen...
Stolen?
The curse will stay with you!
Forever!
Lucky me.
(Rumbling)
(Sighs)
Jackie: Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
"Jackie, please put this on."
What's the point?
It will just burst into flames or...
See?
The curse.
Uncle said I'm stuck with it forever.
But uncle also said the curse
"could be broken, right?"
All we have to do
is get that emerald back to its tomb.
But how are we supposed to find it?
"The Finn, uh, guys,"
could be anywhere by now.
"(Irish accent) Just leave that wee problem to me,"
why don't ya?
(Cheering)
(All gasp)
"Alrighty, now."
Who stole me emerald?
(Gasps) Get out of the garden.
A leprechaun!
"That's right, lads. I'm a leprechaun,"
and if'n you can't say where to find
"the emerald of killarney,"
I'll put the hex on every last one of ya!
I heard about some fellas
trying to sell a Jewel
out at the potato factory.
Then I'll spare ya of me wrath this time.
"Hang on, now."
He's a leprechaun.
"If we catch him,"
he's got to give us his pot of gold.
"Wait! I'm not a leprechaun, ok?"
I got this costume at a--
is this some kind of leprechaun trick?
Any luck?
Both kinds!
Man: The leprechaun!
Get him!
Hurry! This way!
Ya can't outrun Seamus!
(Rip)
What was that?
My pants.
"Ok, what's the plan? Sneak attack or--"
the plan is for you to wait here.
But the curse!
"I will be fine, Jade. I promise."
Heh heh.
It's a potato factory. How dangerous could it be?
(Gulps)
Jackie needs help.
The leprechaun!
Get him!
(Gasps)
"Curse? Nah, there's no curse."
"In fact, my luck has never been better."
"So, 3 million? Deal."
Ha ha! We never made this kind of coin
workin' for the dark hand!
The rolling Finns rock!
Ha ha! My solo debut just went triple-platinum!
No bad luck. No bad luck. No bad luck.
No bad luck. No bad luck. No bad luck.
All: Chan?!
"Well, get him!"
I love this machine!
It's kickin' chan's butt for us!
Man: Gotcha! Second man: You're mine!
"Come here, you!"
"Think, Jade!"
"You can't escape, leprechaun."
"Alrighty, you caught me."
"Now, follow me, and I'll lead you to me pot o' gold."
"Face it, chan. You're no match for Finn halen!"
Now gimme the emerald.
Willingly.
"So, how does it feel to be a loser, chan?"
"Actually, I feel lucky."
Ohh! No! No! Hey! Oof!
Both: Whoa!
Whoa!
This thing <i> is</i> cursed!
Jackie: I know...
And I will take the curse back
if you will just leave me alone.
(Door opens)
Those men have it!
"It's all yours, dude."
"Man: Grrr. Alrighty, hand it over."
I just did. He has it.
"Not the emerald, you pig-ignorant gum."
Every irishmen knows that rock carries a curse!
But the leprechaun told us you lot stole her pot o' gold!
Aah!
"Hey, boss!"
We quit!
You guys can't quit now!
I just settled on a name!
Both: Whew.
Jade: Nothing's gone wrong since we left the tomb.
Looks like you're officially uncursed!
"Yes, I think my luck is finally changing."
"Jackie, look out!"
Aah! Ohh!
Aah!
Aah!
Whoa.
"Black cat, broken mirror,"
and walking under a ladder?
That's like...
80 years bad luck.
But those are just superstitions.
Right?
"Old man: Hey, fella..."
You're standin' right where the trash bin goes.
"Hey, Jackie."
Yes?
What's the hardest thing you've ever had to do?
Typing.
Communication with e-mail.
Internet.
"Anybody write to me-- even Chinese,"
I don't know how to type back.
What can I do?
"Some other things, easy."
"Stunt, rolling, action, I can do it."
I just don't know how to type.
(Alarm blares)
The main vault.
I apologize in advance
"if Jade has been on one of her ""talisman raids."""
(Alarm stops)
Alarm circuit disengaged.
I'm sorry. Do you have clearance?
Captain black.
You did know my technicians
would be installing
the new vault security system today?
"Must have missed the memo, hirsch."
"Ooh, I bet the higher-ups heard I cracked the old system."
Heh heh.
Jade has a very active imagination.
(Whirring)
What are <i> those?</i>
<i>Those</i> would be level 3 classified.
The kid's right.
"Sorry, hirsch."
"Classified or no,"
"<i>those</i> are not on my list, captain."
They will have to go.
What?! - What?!
"I'll handle this, Jackie."
You are so busted.
(Blows raspberry)
Black here.
Operations is insisting we remove level 3 classifieds
from the vaul--
"the talismans, sir."
Right.
The magic ones.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Well? - Well?
We have to clear the talismans
out of the vault.
Pronto.
Captain black is trying
"to pull strings with Washington,"
but it does not look promising.
Hmm.
What's the big whoop?
We can keep the talismans here
in one of uncle's magic boxes.
The risk is too great.
The talismans will be safest
from dark forces
on sacred ground.
We must take them to the Ben-shui temple.
"But--but isn't that, like, near China?"
"Jade, the talismans are unpredictable,"
dangerous.
You should not be playing with them
in the first place.
(Blows raspberry)
(Snip)
Testing.
I'm in.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
"How about one last hurrah,"
for old times' sake?
Hmm.
(Hydraulic humming)
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Aah! Ooh--
(groaning)
"Man: Section 13's a long way from Washington, captain black."
"Black: I promise your trip will be worthwhile, sir."
(Gasps) Black: Follow me.
"Once you see just how powerful these talismans are,"
"I'm sure you'll agree it's imperative we keep them here,"
under lock and laser.
Whew.
Those guys must be blind.
Observe.
The power of...
Invisibility.
"Astonishing, isn't it?"
I could be over here.
Or perhaps I'm over here.
Hmm. Must not be doing it right.
Never mind.
Let's try...
Levitation.
(Grunting)
Uhh...
I...Don't understand. It's--
running a section
"can be very stressful, captain black."
"I'm authorizing 2 weeks of r and r,"
effective immediately.
I suggest you get as far away from here
as possible.
I'm very sorry about this.
You should be sorry.
We are not used to traveling with outsiders.
You are ruining our feng shui.
Uh...I meant about the talismans.
I just couldn't get the rocks to work their magic.
You gotta have the right touch.
Jade...
Not even for demonstration purposes?
No.
Rats!
"Now, be a good girl and play with your moose."
Guh-huh!
"Right on, Mr. mean jeans."
Yes...
Magic approaches.
Potent magic.
Huh?
The talismans of shendu!
Gan. Chui. Ren.
Reclaim the talismans
for the forces of darkness.
(Groans)
We must rest now.
Because the sun is high?
Because uncle is pooped.
Right. I'll scout ahead.
"I'm not tired. I'll scout, too."
Last one up the trail is a monkey's talisman.
Ahoy there!
(Gasps)
Ahh!
You must be the Ben-shui monks.
No! They're daolon wong's dark warriors!
Hello!
Evil forces ahead.
Bad chi rising.
Why are you ignoring me?
What a coinkidink.
We were just on our way to your temple
to give you these.
Jackie!
Jackie! Jackie!
Wake up!
Wake up! - (Snoring)
Aah!
What am I doing there?
Astral projection?
But I didn't touch the tal--
talk to myself later.
Jackie! Wake up!
(Sputtering)
What?
What is it?
Dark warriors! That way!
You guys sure don't talk much.
Vow of silence?
"Jackie: Captain black, no!"
Uncle: They are impostors!
(All gasp)
"Whoa, Nellie."
Jackie!
"Take the talismans to the temple, quickly!"
Uncle! Jackie!
"You won't believe this, but--"
wha--
no! The talismans!
The <i> talismans!</i>
Daah!
Hand over the talismans!
Huh?
Broken?
Told you.
Ohh!
The forces of darkness
have just grown more powerful.
"Do not be concerned, friends."
The power of the talismans lies within.
You got them back?
"Jackie, Jackie."
The holy man speaks in the mystical sense.
"As in, ""may the force be with you."""
"Or, ""we are the world."""
Right?
"Oh, no, no."
The power of the talismans
truly lies...
Within.
"Jade: Jackie, check it out!"
I'm super strong.
Super fast.
Super gone.
Super chimp.
Super talisman powered.
I'm t-girl!
H-h-h-how?
"Not sure, but I think"
"each finger controls a different power,"
which would leave 2 unaccounted for.
Not what I meant!
Oh. Not sure <i> how</i> it happened.
Maybe...
(Gasp) When I got zapped in the vault.
Duh.
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Whoa.
So that's how I do heat beam eyes.
Maybe dragon blast is my bellybutton.
"No, Jade! No dragon blast!"
"The powers must be returned to their proper vessels,"
with a restoration spell.
Ohh...
But we must first retrieve the talismans themselves.
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
"Let's find wong and stomp his ancient, shriveled--"
"but, Jackie,"
I have the power.
Which daolon wong wants.
Which is why you must stay here...
Safe.
The power of...
Invisibility.
Am I over here?
Or perhaps over here?
Uuh?
Pah!
Dragon blast!
(Exasperated snort)
Heat beam eyes!
Forgeries!
We have been tricked!
(Sighs)
"Rooster, ox, snake, rabbit, sheep,"
"monkey, tiger, dog, horse..."
Rat!
Haven't put <i> that</i> bad boy to the test.
Motion to the motionless.
Guh-huh.
Why are we stopping?
Uncle has the willies.
"Daolon: That's not all that you have, old man."
Surrender the talismans and--
let me guess.
No one gets hurt.
Who is this joker?
Whoa! - Whoa! - Whoa!
Daolon wong is a very powerful
dark chi master.
No joke.
"Now, where have you hidden"
"the real talismans, chi wizard?"
That would be none of your beeswax.
Very well.
Ren!
Hyah!
Jade--
thank me later.
"And, please, call me..."
T-girl!
And let's hear it
for her trusty sidekick supermoose!
Guh-huh.
So...
The talisman powers
reside within <i> you.</i>
"Jade, no!"
"Horse and dog, Jackie."
I'm self-healing...
And immortal to boot.
Seize her!
Guh-huh.
Antler action!
Pow!
Bam!
Ooh! Uhh! Uhh...
Ooh...
Heartbreaker.
(Sniffing)
Whoa--
uhh! Hey!
My warriors can smell your magic.
Huh! Huh!
Huh! Hyah! Huh! Whoa!
Hyah! Hyah!
Lion!
And this one's for the moose.
Aah! - Aah! - Aah!
Jade!
Heh. Had heat beams in my eyes.
Huh!
Timber.
(Chanting)
"All right, chi whiz."
"Are you gonna go quietly,"
"or do I have to smoke you, too?"
Wha--
uhh! What the hey?
I...Can't...Move!
"From the neck down like your helpless friends,"
so that you may not draw power
from your fingertips.
Jackie: Jade! No!
Black: Don't make me come over there.
Jade: Jackie!
(Grunting)
(Grunting)
Do not waste your strength.
Someone will come.
Let us hope it is not a wolf.
Or a yeti.
"Well, they have those here, right?"
Guh-huh.
This is a job for supermoose.
(Humming)
I told you someone would come.
Let...Me...Go!
"I had hoped to possess the talismans,"
"but I shall instead, like yourself,"
become them.
Yeah? Too bad you can't get them out of me.
Can't I?
(Sniffing)
Hope he knows where he's going.
Ow!
He is born of talisman magic!
And magic seeks magic.
(Chanting)
Supermoose: Da da da dah ta-dah!
Antler action!
Ohh!
Uhh! Gaach!
Whoa!
Gan! Ren! Chui!
(Gasp)
"Ooh, let's rumble!"
Right beside ya.
No!
Uncle needs your assistance!
Jackie. Hello!
"I may be a rag doll, but I'm still t-girl."
Ohh!
Booster from the rooster.
My pinky!
Chihuahua!
(Yipping)
Cute.
Dragon blast would be nice right about now.
But heat beam eyes will do.
Hand over the girl.
Come and get me.
(Blows raspberry)
Whoa.
The tongue is dragon blast. Wha--
(chanting)
T-girl!
Ohh!
(Chanting)
Guh-huh.
(Repeating chant)
(All chanting)
(Chanting)
(Blows raspberry)
"Save your breath, child."
The absorption process has begun.
"(Black, uncle, and supermoose chanting)"
(Chanting continues)
You are too late.
I have become the talismans--aah--
(chanting continues)
Guh-huh.
Got my bones back.
"I will have my revenge, old man."
Nice spell.
All that daolon absorbed from Jade
was a taste of his own dark chi.
And the talisman powers
have returned to their proper places.
Jade: Ohh...
Do we have to leave the talismans here?
"Yes, Jade,"
I'm afraid that we do.
(Cell phone rings)
Black here.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Yes, Mr. vice president."
I fired off a memo about the talismans
"before we left, and..."
Let's just say the veep's very intrigued
and wants a demonstration.
"Jackie, I think we should celebrate"
by using the horse talisman to heal moosey.
The little fella did dig us out
"of a real mess, Jackie."
Seems the least we could do.
(Sighs)
This is the last time.
Cool!
(Gasp)
"Oh, boy."
"Uh, what was the dragon blast doing"
in the horse talisman?
"(Gasp) Uncle,"
I fear there has been a mix-up.
Hmph!
This never happened to t-girl.
"Hey, Jackie!"
Yes.
What sorts of things do you do to stay in shape?
"Basically, training with my stunt guy,"
"with my student, 3 hour a day."
Lift weight.
Fast--choo-choo-choo choo-choo.
Badminton's good.
Almost nonstop.
Shoo! Shoo!
Ping-pong.
Move your whole body.
Pah! Hah! Hah! Sha!
Also boxing.
The rhythm-- bam-bam-bam-bam. Bam! Bam!
"Training is very important, yes."
"English tour guide: Right this way, please."
Prepare to gaze upon england's greatest mystery.
Stonehenge lies just beyond that hill.
"Who assembled these massive stones, and why? No one knows."
But one thing is certain.
Stonehenge shall forever be--whoa!
(Gasps)
Missing?
There it is.
Your very own fax machine.
"I do not need such a device, Jackie."
Uncle gets all his facts from books.
"Not facts, uncle. <i> Fax.</i>"
It can transmit and receive documents electronically.
It sends paper through the telephone.
This could take a while.
Here. I will show you.
"Jade, please find something we can fax."
How 'bout the news?
Whoa. Check it out.
"""Stonehenge disappears."""
Come on.
This sounds like a job for Jackie chan.
"No, it does not."
While I am very concerned about this theft
"as an archaeologist,"
"I am an archaeologist,"
and this is a job for the proper authorities.
Oh!
"Besides, we already have an exciting mission planned."
We do?
I am taking you overseas
on a real live archaeological dig!
Here. Your very own set
of excavation brushes.
"Oh, Joy."
Jade: England?! I can't believe this.
"The stonehenge crime scene is 50 miles from here,"
and you don't even want to check it out?
"Look, Jade. A button."
"Jackie, everybody knows stonehenge has magical powers."
What if it's fallen into the wrong hands?
"Some people think stonehenge is magic,"
but some people think it is a beacon
for signaling alien spaceships.
"No one knows what stonehenge does, Jade,"
if it even does anything at all.
Hmmph!
"Besides, what wrong hands are you talking about?"
Evil organizations are not hiding behind
every <i> cornerrrr!</i>
Jackie?
<i>...ner!</i>
"All, chanting: <i>Ad nocendum potentes sumo!</i>"
"<i>Ex metu, vires...</i>"
Aah!
Unh.
Huh?
"Uh, hello."
"Uh, sorry to interrupt your function."
I will just find my way--
thou knoweth too much.
Thou must be smoten.
(Gasp) Wait. I do not knoweth anything.
(All chanting in whispers)
Aah!
He seeketh to learn the mysteries of our fortress.
He hath spied the secret library!
"Um, library? What library?"
Uhh! Oh!
He hath discovered the hidden armory.
I'm just looking for an exit!
Aah! He has hath entered
the private water closet.
He is privy to our privy.
(Cell phone rings) Aah!
Hello?
Where did you go?
I've been looking all over.
"Did you know this place has, like,"
a million secret passages?
Aah! - Aah!
Whoa. Who are they?
(Chanting in whispers)
I have no idea.
They must be some kind of secret society.
"An ancient one, judging by the way they spoke."
Cool. Taking on these magical mystery men
almost makes up for missing out
on the stonehenge caper.
We're not taking on anybody.
"These, uh, <i> people,</i> should also be handled"
by the proper authorities.
Captain black? Jackie. How's england?
Dangerous.
"I fell into a hidden fortress,"
and men in robes attacked me with magic spel--
"don't! Oh, no."
"The ""m"" word, Jackie."
"My superiors already think I'm cracking up,"
and they're <i>istening-lay</i>
to my <i> onecalls-fay.</i>
But--
sounds like that went well.
(Scoffs) We'll probably never
"see those wizards again, any--wha!"
Yon knave telleth others of the magisters.
Magisters?
He knoweth our name.
He just said it!
(Chanting)
Aah!
(Chanting) Oh!
Go find the...
Proper authorities.
Help. Bad guys are attacking my uncle.
Come on!
"Um, <i> hello?</i>"
Hot! Hot! Hot!
What kind of proper authority are you?
(Groaning)
Jackie!
Uhh. Ee-yaa!
Tour guide: Right this way...I think.
"I've only ever done stonehenge, you know,"
"and since it's gone missing,"
I'm afraid I'm a bit fuzzy on the rest of england.
"We must away,"
lest more outsiders learneth of our existence.
"Well, we know one thing about these guys."
They like tacky jewelry.
I don't suppose either one of you
knows the way to big Ben?
(Snoring)
Now all we do is fax it to uncle.
Maybe research is a bad idea.
"If they are after us because of what we know,"
do we really want to know more?
"(Scoffs) They're hiding something, Jackie,"
and we gotta find out what.
(Fax machine ringing)
Hello? (Fax transmission beeping)
Huh?!
Ee-yaa! Ee-yaa!
Tohru! The giant phone is possessed!
Jade: Transmission interrupted?
I do not think this is going to work.
Thou hast faxed our insignia.
It didn't go through.
(Chanting in whispers)
All: Aah! The light...
Whither didst they goeth?
Oh. Officer!
"Right. What seems to be the problem, then?"
"Ok, this is gonna sound a little crazy,"
but these robed magister guys are hunting us down and--
say no more. You're safe now.
"See, Jade? We just needed a little help"
from the proper...
Authorities?
Thou knoweth too much.
(Both gasp)
"(Car starts, idles)"
Mayhaps we ought sojourn to someplace more private.
Uhh!
"Jade, I told you to--"
oh. - Aah!
Aah!
(Siren blaring)
Give us the key.
Jade. <i> Please</i> give us the key!
(Whistling)
(Policeman whistles)
(Policeman whistles)
Yon twain knoweth too much.
"No, we don't."
These guys are everywhere.
Uhh-uhh-uhh!
Being handcuffed together is cool.
Unh! Unh!
Sometimes.
Halt!
Ye shalt be smoten posthaste.
This way. Aah! This way. Aah!
Ok. - Ok.
Uhh! - Uhh!
Forget stonehenge.
"This adventure rules, Jackie!"
We should leave before--
methinks yon varlet wisheth to challenge us
in armed combat.
What?
No! I don't wisheth that at alleth.
Have at thee!
Jackie!
Aah!
(Creaking sound)
"<i>Ex metu, vires!</i> <i>Ex metu, vires!</i>"
"Ex metu, vires!"
You don't say.
Aah! Unh!
Oh.
I know your magic words.
"<i>Ex metu, vires!</i> <i>Ex metu, vires!</i>"
"E<i> x metu, vires!</i> Ex metu, vires!"
(Laughing)
Come on already!
Ye twain knoweth nothing of our magicks.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Smite them.
"All: <i> Ex metu, vires!</i> <i>Ex metu, vires...</i>"
Whoa!
Aah!
We have to get help before they find us again.
(Scoffs) From who?
We're fresh out of proper authorities.
Anybody here could be another magister.
Captain black has magic issues.
"The only one who will help us is uncle,"
and he can't even use a fax machine.
"You're right. We are on our own,"
so we had better find out exactly what they don't want us to know.
Let's hope they don't notice the missing robes.
Relax. This is probably the only place in england
where they <i> aren't</i> looking for us.
"""The brotherhood of magisters"
"""was founded during the dark ages,"
"""when their magic inspired fear."
"""But as science progressed, their magic was eclipsed"
"""by the wonders of technology,"
"and their power declined."""
But what are they up to now?
"Uh, Jackie?"
The wizards stole stonehenge?
Told you it has magic powers.
Uncle? Uncle: Jackie?!
This machine is evil.
I am performing a cleansing spell.
"More seaweed, tohru."
"Uncle, please listen."
"Evil wizards have stolen stonehenge,"
and-- (Gasps)
Jackie?
Let go!
Deny it no further.
Thou knoweth too much.
"Well, duh. We do now."
And thou shalt pay for such knowledge
with thine lives.
"Since ye twain dost knoweth too much already,"
I shalt reveal unto thee what no man knoweth--
the true usage of stonehenge.
"Uh, if you don't tell us,"
will we still have to be smoten?
We magisters hath learnt yon stonehenge
to be a magical weapon of mass destruction.
(Scoffs)
And some people think it's a beacon
for signaling alien spaceships.
Ha ha ha.
Thou art ignorant and doomed.
Let the magicks begin.
"With the power of stonehenge,"
we shalt destroy thine major cities one by one.
Thine loathsome modern world
"shalt plunge into a new dark age,"
which we magisters shalt rule once more.
"All, chanting: <i> Ad nocendum</i> <i>potentes sumos...</i>"
The fiery blast we conjureth
shalt broil yon London town.
(Others chanting)
"For somebody who likes his privacy,"
this dude is such a blabbermouth.
Maybe I can... (Strained groan)
Break these...Chains.
And just in case you can't...
"Hey, Jackie."
"(Strained groan) Yes, Jade?"
(Loud click)
Did I ever thank you for these?
Let them escapeth not.
Jackie: Get help.
Aah!
Unh.
Huh?
Aah!
"Ok, let's try this one more time."
"Uncle, evil wizards stole stonehenge and--"
"Jackie told me, so we did research."
"Jade, the wizards are called magisters."
I know.
One more thing.
The society is very secretive.
I know. One more thing.
They use magic words to cast spells.
I know. One more thing.
Bad day. Bad day. Bad day.
Ach!
Ye doest more harm than good.
Thou.
Destroy yon knave by your hand.
Whoa!
Oh.
Oh! Uhh-unh.
"Uncle, on phone: ...And begin a new dark age."
One more thing.
No. No more things.
I already know all that stuff.
The only thing I don't know is how to stop stonehenge
from leveling London and Jackie.
Why did you not say so?
Magic must defeat magic.
(Uncle chanting over phone)
Uncle?
"I may not knoweth any magicks,"
but I know uncle.
(Chanting)
"He can understand sending a spell through the phone,"
but not a piece of paper?
Oh! - Ow! - Ooh!
Yon spell must be finished.
"<i>Ex metu, vires!</i> Unh!"
London town be not destroyed?
Then what dost this stonehenge doeth?!
Put your hands in the air.
Whoa! Who are these guys?
The proper authorities?
"With your testimony, Mr. chan,"
interpol should be able to lock up these magisters
for some time.
I will tell you everything I know.
"Well, Jade, your wish came true."
You helped solve the mystery of stonehenge.
"Yeah, but I still wanna know"
what it's supposed to do.
"We may never know, Jade."
"Hey, Jackie, how do you keep up with all your work?"
I love movies. I love my work.
"The things just keep coming, keep coming,"
keep coming.
"We have I don't know how many restaurants in China,"
"Hong Kong, in Japan."
I have a camera team. I have my stunt team.
I have been working on so many scripts.
4 movies. Dubbing and filming myself. Idea.
So many things. So many projects.
"Yes, I'm sometimes tired, but I'm happy."
This is the entrance to the temple of Shiva?
Ah! Oh!
Dead end.
The temple.
(Gasps) Hak foo?
The bands of Shiva.
"With these, I will be unstoppable."
Stop!
"Uh, do not take that"
"which does not belong to you, uh, mortal!"
Shiva speaks?
With a familiar voice.
Unh!
"Shiva runs, too."
Angry crow takes flight!
Aah!
Rabid hamster climbs wheel!
Whoa!
"I will get you, chan!"
Hak foo really rolls with the punches.
"Ok, disappearing spell,"
what shall we make vanish into thin air?
Homework? (Scoffs) I wish.
Ming vase?
"Uh, kinda priceless."
Bingo!
"Xia xu, xia xu, xia xu sandwich!"
I am da bomb!
Hak foo seemed very interested in having these relics.
And uncle is very interested in having his lunch.
Aiyaa!
Tohru!
Did you eat my mung bean sandwich?
"No, sensei."
"I have been here, baking cookies."
Jade?!
Who needs a sandwich anyway
"when you can have cookies, huh, uncle?"
He who partakes in dessert before lunch
disturbs good chi with bad cholesterol.
"Uh, perhaps we should chew on"
why hak foo may have wanted
shiny new wristbands?
Yours is not to ask.
But to fork over! Arr!
"You break it, you buy it!"
Sensei?
Aah!
Oh...
Tohru! I cannot feel my legs!
"Give me the bands, chan."
"Xia xu, xia xu, xia xu, hak foo!"
What?
"(Gasps) Jackie, no!"
W-what happened?
Where am--we?
Geography later. The bands now!
Shoe!
No one shoos me--aah!
"Jade, echoing: Uncle! Come quickly!"
"Uncle, echoing: Aiyaa!"
Bad dream. Bad dream.
Bad dream. Bad dream. Bad dream!
"Tohru sat on me, and my shop is a shambles!"
"Uncle, I used a disappearing spell on hak foo."
You are not supposed to use magic!
Jackie! Your niece needs a talking to!
Jackie can't hear you
"'cause I disappeared him, too."
(Gasps) What?!
I can hear you!
Jade! Uncle! I'm not disappeared!
I'm...Shrunken?
Aah!
"Surely, there must exist a counterspell."
Most likely.
Which spell did you use?
"The yeoh cheung archive, book 3, page 95."
And which limbo-like void did you choose as the destination?
"Uh, none."
Aiyaa! You must always choose a destination
when casting a disappearing spell.
Jackie could be anywhere!
I sure hope it's somewhere with a phone.
Jade! You're a genius!
(Ring)
Uncle's rare finds. May I help you?
Hello?
"Small or large, I will take the bands."
Who is it? Is it Jackie?
Crank call!
"Come, we must find counterspell!"
"Tohru, I will need eye of wombat."
It's in the refrigerator beside the chopped liver.
Bear fishing for salmon!
Aah!
Ugh! Augh! Pee-yuuu!
Hmm. Sensei did not have lunch.
(Very high-pitched) Tohru!
Tohru! It's me! Jackie!
Jackie!
(Hums to himself)
Monkey climbs vine!
"Oh, visual aid."
Tohru! Over here!
(Hums to himself)
Arr!
Aah!
Ah-ah-choo!
Kangaroo hop!
Ugh! Gah!
(Coughs)
A chocolate chip?
No. No!
No! - No!
No! - No!
No! - No!
(Sputtering)
Tohru! I need that wombat eye today!
"Uh, oh, coming, sensei."
Uh-oh!
This counterspell promises to return that which is lost.
"Wongai, womai. Wongai, womai."
"Come on home, Jackie!"
I lost this kite when I was a young boy.
And I have been looking for this sock.
Hello? We're still short one Jackie.
Waah!
Rampaging rhino rams!
No rhino! No ramming!
"You're going down, chan!"
Arr!
Huh? Aah!
This antidote will release from detention
he who is trapped in another dimension.
"Uh, Jackie?"
"(British accent) It's just me, but thank you ever so much"
for freeing me from that beastly limbo.
Not Jackie.
"(Sniffs) Ah, lunch!"
"Uh, cookie?"
What's a cookie?
(Roars)
Go away!
I must find another spell.
Ya think?
I'm on uncle's spell book.
"Yes, uncle, right here!"
Aah!
This is a lousy spell book.
"From the deepest reaches of the void, we compel you."
Bring forth our Jackie!
Arr! Unh!
Let's try a different kind of spell.
Bring forth a sign of Jackie.
Any sign'll do.
I am trying! I am trying!
Arr!
It is Jackie communicating with us!
"No! Look at your computer, Jade!"
Your computer!
Chan!
"I will help myself to the bands,"
after I delete you!
Aah!
Gazelle bounds on stepping stones!
Can you ask Jackie to communicate with words next time?
English words? Oh...
Aah!
Huh?
"Jackie, where are you?"
"I'm here, Jade!"
Hear?
Time to get within shouting distance.
Aah!
"Excuse me, Jade."
"No, Jade! Wait!"
Aah!
Aah!
"Oh, long way up."
But I will get someone to lend me an ear!
"It's no use, uncle. These counterspells are lame-o."
Billy goat scales mountain.
(Mutters to himself)
What?
These pages are stuck together.
"Jade, you have used half of one spell"
and half of another.
"Combined, these spells would not disappear Jackie,"
they would shrink him to the size of an ant.
Great! That means he's somewhere in...Here.
Aah! Watch your step!
Check your shoes!
Tohru!
Toh--unh!
Hot cha! I will bring Jackie back in a Hong Kong minute.
That's what you said 4 counterspells ago.
Antidote for disappearing spell: Hard.
Shrink spell? Easy.
"Hurry, uncle."
"No, wait! I cannot return to normal size in here!"
Behold the bands of Shiva!
"Uh, yes, they're very pretty, hak foo."
"But please, if we do not leave here fast,"
tohru will be in grave danger.
So I heard.
I shall defeat my 2 greatest enemies today.
Yah!
Ow!
Ah!
Arr!
Spider eats fly!
Spider eats earwax!
I--I hear voices. Jackie's voice.
Screaming about-- about spiders!
"Uh, don't lose your head now, tohru."
Jackie'll be home soon.
"Kwai jong, kwai jong, kwai jong."
Oh!
Unh!
Ooh! - Ooh!
"Uncle: Kwai jong, kwai jong, kwai jong."
"No, uncle! Stop the spell!"
"Kwai jong, kwai jong, kwai jong, kwai jong."
All done.
Tohru! You must stop uncle!
I am inside your head!
Aah!
(Gasps) Sensei!
Jackie says he is inside my head.
(Gasps) There is no room to grow inside there.
You mean tohru's head is gonna go scanner?
I cannot reverse the incantation.
Ah-ah-ah-choo!
Jackie!
Gesundheit!
"Ah, relief."
(Groans)
"Uh, new haircut, hak foo?"
New arms.
To tear you limb from limb.
"Uncle, may I?"
Only this once.
"Xia xu, xia xu, xia xu, xia xu."
Hak foo!
"Aw, not again!"
"Good work, Jade."
"Aw, not really. I was trying to make him disappear."
Hello? Kidding!
"Hey, Jackie? Yes?"
What's your favorite sport?
The basketball is the best.
It's the best
"...and you're sweating, and techniques, good."
"And movement, and the mind, in that second,"
"what are you doing? Ok, back up--"
that's basketball.
Wow. You gonna-- chi-chung.
Huh?
"I can beat Michael Jordan. Maybe, I don't know."
With my martial arts together.
Poom! Chlan!
"Jade: But, Jackie,"
I can't take first prize at the talent show
if I don't have a talent.
"Jade, you have a fine talent..."
For getting into trouble.
Har har.
How about music?
(Plays recorder off-key)
Ugh!
Drill team?
Oof!
Archery?
Perhaps something less hazardous to my health...
(Gasps)
Like ventriloquism.
Huh?
Uncle's not going to like this.
"Jade,"
it's a monkey king!
A what?
Man: The monkey king...
A most revered character from ancient folklore.
Only $20.
"Uh, I don't know,"
he's kinda creepy-looking.
You're not so cute yourself!
Aah!
You know how to throw your voice?
Jackie as puppet: Jackie won a few talent shows
when he was your age.
"You gotta teach me, Jackie!"
No finer puppet with which to learn.
This hand-carved specimen
is the only one of its kind.
We will take it.
(Sinister laugh)
Uncle: You bought this
from my competition?!
"Hey, it broke."
Because it is junk!
Kai ching steals my business
by selling cheap trinkets.
But Kai ching said it was one of a kind.
Ow! Ow!
And that is 2 of a kind to teach you
that bringing my competitor's goods into my shop
invites bad chi.
"One more thing,"
do you see any monkey kings in here? No?!
That is because the monkey king is known
for his love of mischief.
And he is creepy-looking.
"Uncle, please."
"It is only a puppet,"
and Jade's talent show is tomorrow.
You will be sorry.
"Come on, you!"
"Here, Jade."
Let me monkey with it.
Hmm.
An inscription--
"""to free me of glitches and put you in stitches,"
"""this merry ape begs"
"pull my leg."""
Go for it.
(Sinister laugh)
(All gasp)
I'm free!
"Greetings, kiddies!"
The monkey king is in the house!
"Sorry, no autographs."
Nice sumo!
Is he house-trained?
Grrrr!
What have you done with--
(all gasp)
Jackie!
"No! No, no, no!"
(Mock crying)
"What have you done with him, you dirty apes?"
Apes? - Oh. That would be me.
"Ha ha ha. Oh, I'm just pulling your leg."
"Jackie pulled mine, and that's why he's where he is today:"
A proud graduate of...
Marionette u!
"Congratulations, you little dummy, you."
Jackie is not a dummy!
Change him back!
"Well, I could, I suppose,"
"but one of us would have to stay stuck in dollsville,"
and I ain't never going back!
"Besides, as the mandrake of mirth,"
the madcap of monkeys--
"don't confuse me with that other monkey king, Kong--"
I have a long list of pranks to pull!
Ta-ta.
"Tohru, stop him!"
"Gladly, <i> sensei.</i>"
"Jackie, say something!"
See what happens when you do not listen to uncle.
(Bell rings)
Monkey king: Special delivery!
"Oh, please do not laugh."
We are dealing with a very sick mind.
"Uncle, you have to do something!"
I am not geppetto!
I do not bring puppets to life!
You're a genius!
"Well, thank you."
The rat talisman brings motion to the motionless.
This oughta get Jackie back on his feet.
"Well, it's a start."
Jackie: What? What is it?
Uh...Nothing!
Do not look in mirror.
Bwaaaaa!
I told you not to look in mirror!
He never listens.
I am a puppet!
A living puppet!
Not for long.
We're gonna find puff the magic monkey
and make him undo this hoodoo.
A row of ducks.
Always good for big yuks!
¶ Babalu ¶
how do you know the monkey king went this way?
Just following the breadcrumbs.
Whoa.
Did I do that?
(Ship's horn blares)
I'm king of the world!
Aah!
Glacier!
Don't touch the fur!
I'm royalty.
Give me back my body!
Aah! The puppet! It spoke!
Say.
How do you do that? I didn't get to talk when I was wood.
"We'll see what we can do, your majesty,"
if you switch places with Jackie.
So soon?
I hate to quit...
When I'm on a roll.
(Gasps) You've gotta be joking!
Joking is all he does.
Both: Bwaaaaaa!
Aahhhhh!
Come on!
(Groans)
Ha ha ha ha!
(Both panting)
(Both sigh)
Alley oop!
Whoaaaa!
Uhh!
(Gasp) (Gasp)
Both: Noooooo!
"Ooh, instant replay!"
"Jade, wait here."
Whoa!
Knucklehead talks and rocks!
"Go, Jackie."
Mayday! Mayday!
Bwaaaa!
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Whoa! - Whoa!
(Pants)
Why have your doughnut dry
when you can dunk?!
Jackie?!
(Coughs)
"(Laughs) Oh, that was rich!"
A classic monkeyshine!
Ha ha ha!
"All right, chimp,"
you've had your fun.
There is nothing comical about endangering lives.
Ha ha ha ha--
there isn't?
"You two aren't kidding, are you?"
"You want to stop the laughter,"
and I just can't let that happen!
"Ok, we tried reasoning with you."
No more Mr. nice guy.
"Jackie, it's time to give happy boy a heapin' helpin'"
of the ancient art of butt whoop!
If it's a punch-and-Judy show you want...
(Whistles)
Boys...
Cook his goose!
Wait! I have no quarrel with you!
Aah!
Tag team!
Whoa!
Huh?
"Dance, little monkey, dance!"
Jackie!
Ooh. That's got to hurt.
Only my pride.
"Now, students,"
what have we learned today?
You don't want to put the king of comedy in a bad humor!
Tohru: Hold still.
Let's hear it for detachable parts.
"Jackie, do you wish some wax to restore your shine?"
"No, thank you!"
I do not plan on being wooden much longer!
"Isn't that right, uncle?"
"Patience, Jackie."
"Huh?! At this rate,"
I will be a puppet forever!
I do not want to collect dust
"in your shop window, uncle!"
Shouldn't we just ask Kai ching if he knows of a remedy?
What?!
Kai ching is the reason you are in this kettle of fish to begin with.
"Well, that is exactly my point."
You want me to grovel to that snake oil salesman?!
Never! I have everything I need
"to research an antidote for you right here,"
thank you.
I say we see that chuckling chimp about an antidote!
"We have had enough monkey business, Jade!"
And you need to go to school.
"But, Jackie,"
this is way more important
than anything going on at schoo--
(gasps)
The talent show!
It's today! I have to win!
"First prize is a trip to moose world, Florida!"
What am I gonna do?
"Oh, no."
No! No no no!
Um...
A horse walks into a doctor's office.
"The doctor asks, ""why the long face?"""
(Audience laughs)
It's not bad enough those two want to drop the curtain on me.
Now they're stealing my thunder?
"A brief pause in my pranks, then,"
while I kibosh the competition!
"(Whispering) Jade, I don't think this is competing fairly."
"Zip the lips, Jackie!"
You're gonna tank my act!
Stop the show!
(Gasps)
They're cheating!
"The puppet is alive, I tell you!"
It's alive!
(Audience gasps)
"Help me out here, Jackie!"
Just a dummy!
See?
Nothing up my sleeves!
Oh?
Maybe this will put a little spring in his step!
Aah! Hey!
Oh! Ow ow ow!
Heh heh heh! Why bother with ants in your pants
when you could have termites in your tights!
Jackie!
Ha ha!
"If you want real talent, folks,"
watch me pull a rabbit out of this hat!
Har har.
(Audience laughs)
You like me!
You really like me!
(Gasps) Here comes chuckie!
Ohhh. I have found no means
"of reversing the curse, <i> sensei.</i>"
Surely there is a volume we have overlooked!
Monkey...Monkey...
Monkey...
"Perhaps we should visit Kai ching,"
for Jackie's sake?
(Sighs)
All right.
We can't let him escape.
I will be stuck this way!
"Don't fret yet, Jackie."
Trail's still warm!
A lumberyard?
Aah! This is no place for a man made of wood!
Whoa!
Jackie!
Ha ha!
"And when you're sawdust,"
we'll both be feeling chipper!
Ha ha ha ha!
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
You wouldn't!
That's not funny!
Haven't you noticed?
I have a weird sense of humor!
Aah!
Oh! Detachable parts!
Unh!
Fancy footwork!
How much wood does a woodchuck Chuck?
"Oh, my gosh! Look out!"
Huh?
Can't believe - I fell for that old gag.
He keeps his shop open later just to spite me!
Hmmph!
What brings you here?
Nothing. Just browsing.
We wish to reverse the curse of the monkey king puppet.
"Ah, yes."
This contains the answers you seek.
We will take it.
You will purchase it.
$200.
Aah!
You pirate!
This is no trinket.
It is very rare.
$10.
200.
20! My final offer!
"Uh, here's 200."
"Why did you pay retail, tohru?!"
He was weakening!
"Hmm. To reverse the curse,"
the monkey king must pull the leg of its puppet victim.
That is all?! For $200?!
Do you want me to throw in a tea cozy?
Do you want me to throw in
a piece of uncle?!
No purchase necessary!
"<i>Sensei,</i> please."
Dead end!
Up and over!
(Cell phone rings)
Uncle?
What? The monkey king has to pull my leg?
Timber!
Talk later!
Cowabunga!
Aah!
Whoa! - Whoa!
Logrolling?!
Now they're stealing my lumberjack bit!
Whoa! - Whoa!
Whoa--oomph! Whoa--oomph!
Ohhh.
We have to get the monkey king to pull your leg!
Unh! But how can we trick
the ultimate trickster?
"Hey, Jackie?"
How 'bout we rock his world?
"You know, I won a few talent shows"
when I was your age.
Stop me if you've heard this one before.
Hey!
Where is everyone?!
Jackie: Shh!
Here he comes!
Going up!
"Third floor: Housewares, ladies' undergarments,"
puppets!
Jackie: Don't let him see us!
Gotcha!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Unh!
What do you know?
He fell for it!
Uhh! Uhh!
Tough crowd.
I'll help you out of there if you promise
to stop stalking Jackie!
"Oh, sure!"
No problem! Got yourself a deal!
Unh!
Hang on!
I'll grab a stick or something!
Here!
"Prepare to wear pretty concrete slippers, my dear!"
Huh?!
"Uncle said you had to pull the leg,"
he didn't say Jackie had to be wearing it!
That's...Not...
Funny!
The Jack is back!
In the flesh!
And I hope to stay this way.
Knock on wood.
"Hey, Jackie!"
What's your favorite fruit?
I love fruit.
Every morning I get fresh fruit.
"Pineapple,"
papaya!
A lot of papaya!
Banana.
"Very good for the stomach,"
"good for the digest-- uh, good everything."
Banana's good.
Did you ever see a fat monkey?
Uncle: Ha-cha! I see the mansion!
All the treasures of the entire estate
will soon be in my shop.
Uncle has made - the deal of the century.
This place is like Chinese transylvania!
Cool!
"You have seen too many movies, Jade."
Jade? Jade?!
Boo!
Gah!
"Heh heh. Hello, tohru."
Creep-o-rama.
Betcha it's crawling with mummies...
Or wolfmen...Or vampires!
"Sorry, Jade, but monsters like that do not--"
aah! Wolfman!
Wolfman!
"Jade, run!"
"Tch, from a rug?"
"You have come for the antiques, yes?"
"Oh, you should not sneak up on people like--"
greetings. Aah!
Don't do that!
"I'm Mr. lam, executor of the estate."
My assistant will load the acquisitions onto your cart
while you render payment.
Not so fast!
I must first appraise the items.
I do not want my shop to be full of junk.
Then how'd it get so full of junk?
Be assured all the heirlooms
are of the finest quality.
Then you will not mind if I take time to examine them.
They have already been--
not by me they haven't.
You have my word that--
"even so, I would-- just take them and--"
I will do no such-- please.
No. But--
no. But--
no!
"I will - appraise everything,"
or purchase nothing!
The customer's always right.
We will settle your account when you're satisfied.
Enjoy your stay in tsong tse manor.
Perhaps we should warn them.
Do not be foolish.
"If they knew what was hidden among those relics,"
they would never take it off our hands.
This mansion is a gold mine!
We must begin work at once.
Every last item is--
spookyriffic.
Aah!
Can you believe we get to spend the night?
"Yes, Jade."
And can you believe it is past your--
bedtime! Aah!
We creatures of the night never sleep.
"(Evil laughter, giggles)"
Jade!
Gotta give Jackie one last scare before bed.
Perfect.
"Jackie: You are not going to scare me, Jade!"
So don't even try!
Jade?
This isn't a coffee table.
It's a coffin table!
Cool! But why would a coffin have a lock?
Jackie!
Jackie!
There's a vampire--aah!
I told you you would not scare me.
"It was a real vampire, Jackie,"
"with fangs and claws, and it tried to grab me,"
"but I slammed the lid, and it's trapped inside the--"
(gasps)
Vampire on the loose! We gotta get outta here.
"Ok, aah. I am so scared."
Now will you go to bed?
"Jackie, I'm totally serious. There's a real--aah!"
There it goes!
"But it was-- Jade, please--"
"it's late, and-- - look!"
It--
"I'm sure this is very funny to you, Jade, but--"
"Jackie, look! He's right--please--"
Jade! - Just--
you said that last-- no.
I've had enough.
"But-- no ""buts."""
Bed.
"Jackie, uncle is ready to begin the appraisals."
(Growling)
Jackie?
Hello?
(Muffled noises)
Jackie?
(Growling)
(Gasps)
(Moaning)
You can't leave me alone!
Don't you ever watch scary movies?!
The beautiful girl is always the first to--
(thud)
"I'm sure it was just a little thunder, Jade. Now--"
ohh.
The vampire got tohru!
Hmm. No. Jet lag got tohru.
"Our flight was 18 hours long, Jade."
He is tired.
(Moaning)
"Hello! Does this look like ""tired"" to you?!"
How can uncle appraise with no helpers and so much yell--
(gasps)
Aiya!
"Jackie, guard the door in case it returns."
"""It""?"
"Hidden inside of an antique,"
Mr. lam tried to trick us into taking it.
"What is ""it""?"
A kiang chi.
A vampire.
Told ya.
Did a little monster put you up to this?
Chinese vampire drain chi--
"life energy from their prey,"
making the vampire stronger
and turning their victims into servant.
"Without any chi, tohru will soon transform"
into a fiendish Minion of darkness!
We must perform a chi transfusion.
Transfusion? You want to put someone else's chi in tohru's body?
"Tch, where are you gonna find someone"
with that much extra--whoa!
You have abundant youthful energy--
chi to spare.
It is the only way to prevent tohru from serving the undead.
(Chanting in Chinese)
Cool.
Are you sure it is not jet lag?
I have not seen this vamp--aah!
Aah!
"Oh, thank you, tohru."
I just slam-dunked a chi-sucker.
I rule!
"Go, tohru! Go, tohru! I'm the bomb!"
Hmm. It appears the chi transfusion was successful.
"Go, Jade! Go, Jade!"
Lotta-chi girl saving tohru!
(Growling)
It can fly?
Not for long it--aw!
This is a Chinese vampire.
A wooden stick will not harm it.
Then how do we stop--
(growling)
Whoa!
Do not breathe.
The kiang chi is blind.
It can only find you if it smells your breath.
You are making this-- (Gasps)
Gi-gi-gi--
gi-ee!
Ah-choo!
Aah!
Unh!
(Gasps) - No!
Jade!
"Give it back, you chi-hog!"
Whoa!
Unh!
So unfair.
Hurry uncle
"uncle, you have to perform another transfusion."
(Moaning)
Jade cannot hold her breath.
The vampire will follow her and find us.
Then let's roll!
We will be safe on the other side of the river.
The kiang chi cannot cross running water.
Where are you getting these rules from?
(Chanting in Chinese)
(Chanting stops)
Cart surfing!
(Chanting)
Whoa!
Aah!
Oops.
(Chanting)
(Moaning) Huh?
The transfusion spell is com--
hello! Duck!
(Moaning)
Uncle!
Hang on! We're almost...
There.
How are we gonna save uncle without uncle?
We must do research.
You've gotta be kidding me.
He's starting to go all fangy.
(Moaning)
Uncle is turning into the vampire's Minion.
Use my chi for the transfusion.
Ow!
I do not know such spells.
"Jade has uncle's chi,"
not his brains.
(Moaning)
"Ok, he's, like, really freaking me out now."
Ha-cha! You found a spell?
"No, but I know how to get our chi back from the vampire."
"Later, we need - a transfusion spell now."
"Uh, actually..."
I think we just ran out of time.
I will vanquish you and feed your chi to my master.
Aiya!
He is a servant to the vampire.
"Duh! Uncle,"
"we are your friends,"
"your family, and I know you do not want to harm--"
"uncle, we will not fight you."
(Snarling) Aah! - Unh!
"Tch, like he's giving us a choice."
You must keep him busy while I learn how to subdue him.
My master will feast upon your chi.
"Please, learn fast!"
(Yelling)
Whoa! Oof!
Unh.
Ha-cha!
"Remember books, uncle?"
You love books.
Ha-cha!
"As long as the parchment spell is in place,"
uncle cannot move.
You are doomed!
Aah!
One more thing--
he can still talk.
"You may have defeated the servant,"
but you shall never defeat the master.
The glorious one will devour every last bit
of your delicious chi.
Shoulda put that paper over his mouth.
"We must all reclaim our chi before sunrise,"
or it will belong to the vampire forever.
"You mean, I'd be stuck in Jade mode?"
You would rather have uncle's chi?!
I cannot stop thinking about digestion!
Then my master will drink you dry.
Drink you-- (Muffled)
How do we take back the chi?
"Easy, we just hunt down count jerkula and--"
no! Magic must defeat magic.
"We must collect a toadstool from a graveyard,"
"place it inside the vampire's left sock,"
and throw the sock into a river.
You're making this up.
"You want to stop the kiang chi, yes?"
Then do what Jade tells you!
One more thing--
we must hurry. The sunrise is in 13 minutes.
"Come on, Jackie."
It's vampire butt-kick time.
This is too weird.
"Quickly, Jackie."
We must find the toadstool
before the vampire finds us.
Boo!
Aah!
Heh heh.
Couldn't help myself.
It is my master who will help himself
to a heaping helping of your succulent chi.
Ha-cha! I have found a toadstool!
"Now, we just have to find the--"
"tohru, please stop playing."
Aah!
Jackie! - The vampire!
Master!
I see you.
You can see?! You can talk?!
"With so much chi to nourish me,"
I have grown stronger.
"I can withstand anything,"
even the light of day.
(Grunting)
Huh?
Got it!
"The other left sock, tohru."
Oops.
"Excellent kick, o dark one."
Whoa!
Master! I have fallen...
And I cannot get up.
"In moments, the collective chi will be mine for--huh?!"
Heh heh. Nice shoe.
(Growling)
"Jade may have uncle's chi,"
but Jade is still Jade.
Boo!
Hyah!
(Chanting)
¶ We knocked your socks off ¶
(sniffing)
Eww!
"(Sniffing) Master, is that your sock?"
(Screaming)
Cool!
Who stuck special parchment to uncle's head?!
"Um, maybe you should get out of the sun."
So everybody's chi is back where it belongs?
"Thank you for the loan, Jade."
It was...Cool.
"No problem, big t,"
but I don't think uncle got all his chi back.
I have this monster craving for mung beans.
I am just glad this horrible trip is over.
"Horrible?! What do you mean, ""horrible""?!"
"Because of the kiang chi,"
uncle bargained Mr. lam down to half price.
And he threw in a very nice table for no extra charge.
"Hey, Jackie, why do you think it's so important"
to be defensive rather than offensive?
"On the bus, somebody come to grab you--"
bom! Always defense.
"When they touch you, you just turn, turn."
"You know, protect. Everything to protect."
"It's better than fight somebody,"
"because for one small argument,"
you hurt somebody. You never happy in your whole life.
"So that's why in my movie, you can see there's a lot of protect things."
In the real life...
Defense better than...
To hit somebody. Remember. Yeah.
(Gasps)
The infiltration spell was successful?
Yes.
Now evil shall truly prevail.
What's uncle doing now?
"Jade, - if you listened once in a while,"
you might not need to ask
so many questions.
What was that?
"The incense ritual honors uncle's teacher,"
chi master fong.
(Gasps)
A spirit is among us!
Cool.
It is chi master fong.
He wishes to tell me something.
He's gonna have to speak up.
Shh.
"To communicate with the spirits,"
we must open all of our senses.
Darkness approaches.
(Chiming)
An ill omen from the north.
The falcon leaves its perch.
"What does it mean, uncle?"
"Like the falcon,"
we must take our leave northward
to suppress the forces of darkness.
Duh.
The hidden valley.
Its location has remained secret for centuries.
What's the big whoop?
Looks like any another misty monkey valley.
There.
Whoa. Mount chimpmore.
The great idol of the 3 wise monkeys.
Legend tells that it is filled with dark chi.
The idol is evil?
No. The 3 wise monkeys are guardians.
Good wizards
sealed the dark chi within them long ago
"so that humanity may neither see, hear,"
nor speak of such evil.
Hoo.
"What is it, <i>sensei?</i>"
The willies.
No doubt the forces of light have summoned you here
since I possess the only existing map.
Daolon wong!
The anti-uncle.
"So, you have come to steal the dark chi!"
"Not steal it, good chi wizard,"
unleash it.
But that will upset the balance
between good and evil!
Indeed.
(Chanting)
"Jackie,"
daolon must not complete his spell!
"Go, uncle."
(Chanting)
Unh.
(Groans)
Daolon is gone!
Uncle: As is the idol.
Whoa.
"Mount chimpmore is gone, too!"
That is what I just said.
"Daolon is gone,"
and he took mount chimpmore with him!
"Stop shouting, Jade. I am old, not deaf."
"Speak up, Jackie! I cannot hear you!"
How can you see through this cloud of dark chi?
There is no dark chi cloud.
Then why can I not see you?
"Uncle, no sound is coming out of Jackie's mouth!"
Because Jackie is mute.
"Uncle, no sound is coming out of <i> your</i> mouth!"
Jade is deaf.
<i>Sensei?</i>
And tohru is blind.
What is it?
What'd uncle say?
We are like the 3 wise monkeys.
"What?! - Speak up, tohru!"
"I said, we are like--"
"yo, tohru, over here!"
"I don't think ""t"" can see!"
"Why were you not affected, <i> sensei?</i>"
"As a student of master fong,"
I am protected by an abundance of good chi.
"If I'm deaf and tohru is blind,"
that means uncle must be mute!
"Jackie, I can't hear you! Duh!"
I cannot read your lips. Your accent is too thick.
"Uncle, what are we gonna do?!"
Find daolon wong and stop him
before he unleashes more dark chi.
More dark chi?
Your afflictions are but a demonstration of its power.
"Under daolon's control,"
multitudes will be rendered senseless.
(Yelling in fear)
(All gasp)
"Dark chi of ages past, I summon you forth."
Spread your plague upon the land.
(Concerned murmuring)
"Dark chi, I summon you."
My spell worked before.
Something is missing.
(Chanting)
Of course.
The dark chi may only be released
in the presence of a good chi wizard.
<i>Gan. Ren. Chui.</i>
Bring the old man to me.
How can we hope to defeat daolon wong
in our condition?
By not relying on your missing senses.
"For instance,"
"I do not see so well anymore,"
so I have strived to sharpen my hearing.
"But you do not hear so well, either."
So must you 3 strive to sharpen your other senses.
Whoo. Garlic!
I think we're downwind from uncle.
See? You are not handicapped.
You are handi-capable.
Learn to listen to nature.
Feel the wind on your face
and the earth beneath your feet.
Form an image of the world in your mind's eye.
Ahh.
Maybe we should work on some alternative
"means of communication, Jackie."
"Ok, when you want me"
"to use my chungking express maneuver,"
give me one of these:
"You are doing very well, tohru!"
"Yes, <i> sensei.</i>"
It is as if I can see.
Whoa. (Grunting)
Aiya.
Do this for the high-flying whirlygig.
No. This.
"Jackie,"
the dark warriors!
They're after uncle!
Let's get 'em!
You want a piece of uncle?
Hoo.
"You will pay for that, dark warriors!"
Dark warriors?
(Tohru yells battle cry)
"Dark warrior, be gone!"
Whoa.
(Grunting)
(Chanting)
Uncle!
Why would they take uncle?!
Probably to disable us further.
How will we stop daolon without <i> sensei's</i> guidance?
How will we find him?
Whoa.
Chi master fong will help us find uncle.
We just gotta open all our senses
like uncle did.
Good idea.
(Bird caws)
East! East!
East!
All: East.
Oh. (Grunting)
Unhand me.
Only once all of the dark chi is released--
"with your humble contribution,"
my accomplice.
(Grunting)
You will be so sorry!
"With the senses of humankind dulled,"
evil shall roam freely.
(Concerned chatter)
I can't see!
"Man: Oh, it's dark."
It would appear
"you are the appropriate yin to my Yang,"
good wizard.
(Laughing)
Let us venture forth
and spread more darkness.
No sign of uncle.
Maybe chi master fong
was chi master <i> wrong.</i>
Whoa!
Flying monkeys!
Where?
"Daolon's up top, front and center!"
And see that wee bitty thing next to him?
I'm pretty sure that's uncle's head!
"Hey, my other senses <i>are</i> sharper!"
"Ok, team, this is what we've been training for."
"Let's haul deaf, mute, and blind butt up that rock!"
(Grunts)
"Uh, what's that, Jackie?"
You want to join a bowling league?
(Groans)
(Concerned chatter)
Man: I can't see!
"Second man: Oh, it's dark."
Straight up?
Ready?
(Grunts)
"Oh, my mind's eye sees trouble."
(Tohru grunting)
"Whatever you do, ""t,"" don't look down."
(Groans)
Oops. Heh.
(Chanting)
"I know, I know."
"But this time, it's different, Jackie."
I can be t's eyes and your mouth.
"Besides, do the math."
"3 wise monkeys, 3 of us."
And 3 dark warriors.
Whoop.
"Ok, you run interference, Jackie."
We'll get uncle.
(Tohru grunts)
Charge!
Get ready.
Hop!
Your disabled disciples cannot possibly defeat me.
Not disabled. Handi-capable.
Whoa! Turn!
Stop! Stop!
Turn.
"1, 2, 3, catch!"
Jump!
Daolon: Aah!
"Hi, uncle! Looking for these?"
"Thank you, Jade."
Wave them over--
can't hear you!
(Muffled chanting)
(Spits)
(Daolon coughs)
Very well.
You shall suffer the same fate
"as chi master fong, good wizard."
I do not think so.
One more thing:
Chi master fong says hello.
No.
Aah!
No!
"Hey, yell in your own ear!"
Whoa. I can hear.
"Tohru, are you ok?"
(Gasps)
I can speak!
Wah!
I can see!
(Loud) Where'd mount--
"(softer) I mean, where'd mount chimpmore go?"
"Back to the hidden valley,"
where it will hopefully remain for many more centuries.
"How can you be certain, <i> sensei?</i>"
Have you learned nothing?!
Chi master fong tells me so.
And he also tells me he's pleased
that the balance between light and dark
has been restored.
Not without casualties.
Look out.
Ooh.
He should've listened.
Daolon has been cursed with all 3 afflictions.
He will have to train very hard
to become handi-capable.
(Villagers cheering)
"Yes. - Hey, Jackie?"
How high can you jump?
"After I've broken my ankle,"
and also I've broken my toes.
"Right now, I cannot bend my toes,"
"and I lose a lot of, you know, bouncing things."
"So, this way, when I'm making a movie,"
I know my own problem--
my broken ankle.
My knees get hurt because--from the injury.
"So, this way, when I run,"
"it's like, uh, running, running,"
"maybe one step on the chair,"
then I jump to another things.
But I'm fine.
I still can-- still do a lot of things.
"And bouncing, bouncing, bouncing."
"My Patience wears thin, valmont."
Every moment spent imprisoned in this stone casement
is an eternity lost.
"I assure you, shendu,"
my men are spending every waking moment
searching for your talismans.
"Aw, come on, I wanna see the baseball scores."
"Uh-uh, not till I finish checking out stuie kablooey."
He's the bomb.
You two. Come closer.
Show me the parchment.
"Are you a giants fan, shendu?"
(Hisses) Turn it over!
The hair plugs ad?
The statue of lo pei.
"Ha, you wanna see lo pei?"
You ought to check out my salary.
Get it? Low pay?
Fools! Lo pei was the warrior
who scattered my talismans
to the 4 corners of the earth
and turned me into a statue.
"Well, I guess somebody"
"did the same to him, huh?"
What goes around comes around.
"No, that is simply a statue made of terra cotta."
Whose leggings Bear inscriptions.
(Hisses) Which may provide precious clues
as to the whereabouts of the remaining talismans.
Bring the terra cotta warrior to me.
"Hurry, uncle. We're on a very tight--"
ow! The great wall was not built in a day.
Translations are very tricky.
School to uncle's in 3.5 minutes. A new record!
And the crowd goes wild.
No!
Oh--
oh! What did you do?!
What did <i> you</i> do?
You put an old junk heap
in the middle of the floor.
That old junk heap is a priceless antiquity
on loan from the museum.
Desecration of a sacred artifact.
This is very bad.
It's just a crack.
Heh.
"Ohh, broken statue."
Sorry.
- Broken statue. - Sorry.
Broken statue. Sorry.
Jasmine tea to calm the nerves.
"Yes, I can see my future in the tea leaves."
"The museum contacts the university,"
my career winds up like that statue.
Ruined. Ow!
Your career not important!
"Now, we will never read the inscriptions."
Knowledge has been lost forever.
Must call my insurance agent.
See if I'm covered for this.
Look.
All we gotta do is figure out
which pieces go where.
Like a Jigsaw puzzle.
I'm just trying to help.
I think you've helped enough already.
(Scoffs) Think again.
"""Statue of warrior lo pei,"
"ling dynasty, wantoon region."""
So where is it?
Someplace in China.
I meant the statue.
Says here it's on loan...
To Jackie chan.
Jackie!
Uncle.
Broken statue has disappeared.
(Gasps) But how? The dark hand?
(Gasp) (Gasp)
"We know you got the statue, Jackson."
Where is it?
It's missing. Broken.
Broken. Missing.
You need to get your story straight.
"Ok. But first, tea."
"Huh, ooh, wha--whoo!"
Ah-aah! Yeeow!
Jackie! Tea pot is antique!
Thank you.
"Time to cut to the chase, chan."
And I do mean cut.
Waaa?!
Jackie!
"Waste of time, dudes."
Yeah. The statue's not even here.
I got errands.
"So, if the dark hand"
"did not take the broken statue,"
then who?
My little helper.
The healer.
"Ok, humpty dumpty, maybe all the king's horses"
"couldn't put you back together again,"
but he never had one of these.
Yes!
Jackie will be stoked.
Especially if I help uncle figure out
what these chicken scratches say
about the talismans.
As if.
Why not get it right from the horse's mouth?
Motion to the motionless.
"Ok, rat, do your thing."
Yes!
Where am I?
"The real world. Cool, huh?"
"Now, talismans pop quiz time."
Talismans? What do you know of the--
the horse!
Yep. Used my little pony here
"to do a patch job on your, uh, self."
How can this be?
"As the dandelion scatters its seeds to the 4 winds,"
so did I scatter the talismans
to the 4 corners of the earth.
"That was then, and this is section 13."
"Got a mess of 'em right here,"
safe and-- here?
"Well, not right here."
"Downstairs in the, uh, vault."
Show me!
"Uh, can't. You've gotta have clearance to--"
"oh, boy."
"As the silkworm senses the nearness of the armored beetle,"
I sense the talismans are at hand.
Not even warm.
"Oh, well. So close."
But you need a pass key.
Energy scroll.
Or one of those.
Some are missing. Where is the dog?
The pig? The monkey? The rat?
"Uh, the rat's closer than you think."
"See, when I brought you to life,"
it kinda got stuck inside your--
(crash)
"I must once again safeguard these,"
lest they fall into the hands
of the ultimate evil.
Freeze!
"Yes, you will."
Immobilizer scroll!
Hold your fire.
Watch out for the child.
Energy scroll.
Really. I can explain.
"No need. The intruder was obviously an emissary of the dark hand,"
utilizing a high-octane nerve gas.
You were foolish to try and stop him on your own.
But also very brave.
"Yeah, well, I try to be of help."
"Yes, and I wish you would stop helping."
(Gasps) The talismans! How?
"Uh, you know that broken statue?"
"Well, he's not so broken anymore."
"Uh, what?!"
"Don't worry, Jackie. I can help."
"Oop, the ""h"" word."
"I meant help find the warrior,"
not help do the laundry.
"Sorry, miss. Orders."
"Ugh! ""One cup per load. Do not overuse."""
Hmm.
"Tour guide: Next stop, the rock, a.K.A. Alcatraz."
"Although no longer in use, it was once the most famous,"
most impenetrable prison in the world.
Impenetrable.
Levitation scroll!
Whoa! Call maintenance.
"Uh, he looks like this."
"Only he's not a statue, right?"
"Tour guide: Though originally built as a civil war fort,"
"Alcatraz served as a federal penitentiary from 1934 through 1963,"
"housing some of the world's most notorious criminals,"
including al Capone.
A worthy place to secure the first talisman.
Energy scroll!
"Wait, please!"
Don't do that.
Who are you?
I'm the one who borrowed you from the museum.
You need to come home.
"And the talismans need to be returned to section 13,"
out of reach of the dark hand.
I know nothing of dark hands.
"Only that the talismans must remain hidden,"
lest they fall into the hands of the ultimate evil.
The ultimate evil? What is that?
You dare ask a sacred warrior to speak its name?
But you're not a warrior.
You're a statue. Terra cotta. Uh--
(hollow clucking)
I-I-I'll prove it to you.
Scroll magic.
Oof. Whoa!
"Actually, <i>daily tribune.</i>"
"Ok, new plan."
How about we work together?
You know the location
"of the remaining talismans, right?"
Yes. And that is knowledge you shall never possess.
Energy scroll!
Ooh!
Ah-ah-ah-oh.
Jackie.
"Big city, small statue."
"What's shendu think, we're gonna see it walkin' around?"
Don't know. But we got a read on a talisman.
Whoa. It's the statue.
But he's moving.
"Uh, don't usually see that kind of behavior in a statue."
"Unless he's packin' talisman, huh?"
Guess the boss would want us to confiscate it?
"Yeah, but what the boss don't know can't hurt us."
I can dig it.
Ooh.
Aah!
Oh--
unh!
Finn: And he was whuppin' chan pretty good.
"Rather ironic, is it not, shendu?"
A statue of the man who turned you into a statue
is no longer a--
silence!
"So, lo pei has become a living being."
Probably used the talisman. Oof!
"Lo pei possesses a talisman,"
and your men do nothing to retrieve it?!
"Big v, you should've seen the guy."
He's packin' paper.
Exploding kind.
We'd be toast.
You are expendable.
"However, the talismans are not."
You shall employ a weapon more powerful than scrolls.
Cunning.
"You will convince lo pei you are his allies,"
fellow warriors of the ling dynasty.
"Uh, maybe you haven't noticed, shen-dude,"
but we don't exactly have that ancient warrior look.
Hi. Remember me?
"Out of my way, child."
Child?! I released you.
"You should be calling me master,"
and granting me wishes.
"Look, I really messed up,"
and I want to make things right.
"How about we just hop the number 4 bus to section 13,"
return the talismans to the vault?
"No harm, no foul."
"What do you say, big guy?"
What is this strange gesture?
It means a-ok. We're pals.
The small one is no pal.
"She is the enemy, o great lo pei."
You know my name?
Sure. We're your homies.
"Talk flowery, like shendu said."
"I--I mean, uh, fellow warriors from the ling dynasty,"
come to help.
"As, uh, the dew helps the morning glory to blossom."
"Oh, yeah. That's us."
No way you're buying this.
The emperor sent us to help you hide the talisman--
talismans.
"You got so many, he figures we can do it faster and cheaper."
They are so lying. They're the dark hand.
Bad guys. Enemies of Jackie and me!
"Yeah, lo pei, you know Jackie."
The guy who was trying to bust you up
back on Alcatraz.
He's her uncle.
"Uh, by marriage."
"Hardly know him, really. Heh."
As the Lily pad offers respite
"to the weary bullfrog,"
so your service to our cause is much appreciated.
No--unh. Let go! Unh.
A sacred warrior would never harm a child.
You are impostors!
Yes.
(Gasps) Look out!
Your cab's here.
Unh! Oh!
Hey. Big tipper.
Unh!
Energy scroll.
"Uh, uh, power up!"
"Um, abracadabra?"
Lo pei: Levitation scroll!
You're ok.
"Yes, but I have no wound."
"Well, that's 'cause you're a statue."
Those false warriors in the employ
of the ultimate evil
now possess the talismans.
I have failed.
Wait. We can get 'em back.
Where's that old sacred warrior spirit?
Eye of the tiger. Never say never.
Hoo-ah!
Jade! No! Don't hurt her.
"It's ok, Jackie. Me and lo pei are pals."
Pals. A-ok.
And the talismans?
"Oh, those."
"Well, the dark hand kinda got the drop on us,"
"and...Eh, heh--"
oh.
"We'll get the talismans back. Warriors, yes!"
"Warriors, no."
"You are a child,"
and I am an archaeologist.
"Er, though not for long"
if I don't get you back to the museum.
"Again, you speak nonsense."
"As the Crescent moon is duty-bound to follow the sunset,"
so shall I smite this dark hand.
Hoo-ahh!
(Quietly) Hoo-ahh?
It's an ancient warrior thing.
What is the meaning of this?
"Rooster, ox, bunny, horsey."
We got the whole kit 'n' caboodle.
Shendu: You failed to mention the rat.
"Uh, sorry, big cheese, no rat."
Honest. We checked all his pockets.
"(Hisses) That is because lo pei carries it within him,"
you fools!
You will remove it or face my wrath.
How are we supposed to get it from inside the guy--
bran flakes?
You were speaking the truth.
I am a statue.
"But if this is true, how--how can it be?"
Motion to the motionless.
Mmm...
The power of the rat.
"Hey, come on."
Everybody likes a statue.
The dark hand!
Why? They have all the talismans.
"No, they do not."
Duh.
Immobilizer scroll!
"Go, lo."
Shadowkhan.
You must go.
As the bamboo stands firm
"against the furious hail,"
so shall I stave them off
so long as I am able.
I entrust you to guard the talismans
and keep your world safe from the ultimate evil.
I understand. Thank you.
"Good-bye, pal."
Energy scroll!
We can't just leave him.
You think I want to?
He's on loan from the museum in my name.
But we have to secure the talismans.
The statue is as good as new.
"Uh, I mean old."
"Better, even. You need to see this, Jade."
Why?
(Gasps)
Hoo-ahh!
"Man: Hey, Jackie."
Yes?
Do you collect anything?
I collect a lot of miniatures.
My secretary put my little picture inside.
Did you see that?
"I was in Russia,"
and there's a big lock behind my shoulder pack.
"When I'd walk, it was like this."
"Because it's, like, really, really heavy."
"I--right now, I have more than"
"1,000 cup and saucers."
I'm a pretty funny person.
I collect a lot of funny things.
Aah!
"Hi, Jade."
(Gasping) Jackie.
Don't sneak up on me like that.
"Oh, I was sneaking up on you?"
You're supposed to be back at the hotel.
"Sure, limit my exposure to other cultures."
Stifle my educational potential.
"Jade, I'm only trying to stifle your potential to be harmed."
"What if the dark hand were here, too,"
looking for the snake talisman?
Did you find it?
"Ah, not yet."
You'd think it were invisible.
Oh! The dark hand!
Stay here.
I thought you meant here with you.
Welcome to another episode of <i> just the artifacts.</i>
Your passage to the thrilling world of archaeology.
"I am your guide, Wesley rank."
"And today, I have braved the treacherous anaconda falls"
to bring you to a secret site--
"the legendary lost temple of <i> culebra gigante,</i>"
"a monstrous serpent,"
said to be thousands of years old.
And look!
This ancient chalk drawing
clearly indicates that a snake cult
"once worshipped their fearsome idol,"
right here on this very spot.
"Tsk. Not much of a temple, is it?"
"And as for <i> culebra</i> <i>itself,</i> well--(Laughs)"
No big snakes around here.
What a goofball!
"Jackie, why don't you get in front of the camera"
and tell him a thing or two?
"Jade, I don't want to be on TV."
We are on a top-secret mission.
No one must know what we're looking for.
You there!
Can't you see we're filming?
Who are you two?
"Uh, we're, um--"
archeologists.
Stop that! I mean cut! Cut!
Edit them out.
Camera hog.
This is my dig. There's nothing here for you. Go away.
What are you looking for anyway?
Uh...The exit. Bye-bye.
Chan...
We really have to stop using the same travel agent.
The dark hand!
More archaeologists?
"Quite the popular ""secret"" site."
The talisman.
I don't know what you're talking about. Ohh!
Talisman?
The snake talisman.
(Grunts)
Hyah!
Aaii!
Oww! Ohh!
Whoa.
Wow! He's an archeologist?
Jackie's totally ready to host his own show--
"educational, but with an action/adventure slant."
We're thinking of calling it <i>Jackie chan can.</i>
I'm the plucky cohost.
"Aw, cut! Cut!"
"Edit that out, too."
Tch. Rank is totally rank.
Whoa...The snake talisman!
Hmm...
Talisman.
Whoaa!
"Twofer. Jackie, look!"
"Busy, Jade."
Sorry. Camera loves him.
I want another shot of that.
Get in tight.
Down!
Aah! - Aah!
(Gasping)
Ratso?
Ratso. Ratso!
Heh heh. Did you see all the fishies?
Ow! - Ow! - Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Piranha! Piranha!
(Grunts)
Come on. The snake talisman was part of the drawing.
Right over...
Here?
"Oh, it's gone!"
Destroyed!
The dark hand? No.
They were too preoccupied.
Then who?
And thus <i> just the artifacts</i> has the exclusive scoop
"on this infamous snake talisman, whatever that is."
You do think everyone was fighting
"over the chalk drawing, don't you?"
"Uh, maybe we should ask an archeologist."
<i>I am</i> - <i>an</i> a<i> rcheologist.</i>
"Oh, right. Destroying 4,000-year-old drawings, yeah."
That's what archaeologists do.
"Pipe down, you."
Oh...
(Cell phone rings) Hello?
"Jackie, did you find the snake talisman?"
"No, uncle."
There was only a big empty cave
with a drawing of the snake talisman.
And a ton of bats.
Wha? You are not supposed to be in a cave of bats.
"You are supposed to be in the temple of snakes,"
guarded by one very big snake.
"Well, there was no big snake and no temple."
And now there is no drawing.
"Well, we can always see it on rank's show."
Or we can find rank now and get a sneak preview.
"Uh, no big v. - We haven't spotted chan yet."
"In fact, we're still at the airport."
A mix-up with the bags.
"Yeah, I told tohru we should just do carry on, but, hey, whatcha gonna do?"
Yoop!
(Gasping) Hang on.
T-monster wants ya.
"Rest assured, master. We will find your talisman."
And I will break Jackie chan.
Time to tuck you in.
(Snoring)
We're in the middle of nowhere.
What are we going to view it on?
Tch. They do a TV show.
Bwaa!
Chirp chirp. Chirp chirp.
Chirp chirp. Chirp chirp.
Heh. Sorry.
Here you go. The talisman. See?
Yes. But what does it mean?
"Aw, crikey!"
Sorry we didn't rewind. Thank you.
I had the weirdest dream--
a bird that chirp like a car alarm.
That was no dream. That was thieves!
Dahh--ahh...My tape.
"Wait, they went to all this trouble, and didn't take it."
Perhaps there's more to this drawing than the drawing itself.
"Ooh, that's deep."
"Zip it, you."
Why does the snake bite its own tail?
Maybe it can't see what it's eating
because it's got a talisman stuck in its eye.
The snake biting its tail symbolizes the circle of life.
The end is in the beginning!
"The drawing was a map, telling us"
that the talisman is at the cave where we began.
In the eye of the snake?
Could be dangerous.
You're going back to the hotel.
Oh...
"Hi, Jackie."
"Jade, stop following me."
"I got here first. Technically, you followed me."
(Sighs)
Don't bother. I checked everything.
No sign of a temple or a talisman.
Whoa. Score one for the jackster.
The temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>
Right under our noses.
More like right above our heads.
Snake eye.
See Jackie? Nothing to worry about.
The snake's not even real.
Wait here.
"Yeah, yeah."
(Grunting)
(Sighs) Huh?
A snake!
Ahh! Ah!
"Jackie, they're all snakes!"
"Bad snake, bad snake, bad snake. Yaa."
Uhh!
Uhh. Ahh...
(Sighs)
"Jackie, you scaled it!"
"Er, so to speak."
(Grunts)
Oh! Ohh!
I got it. I got it!
"How wrong you are, little lady."
"Eh, you there, camera guy."
"Roll film, quickly."
"Welcome, I'm Wesley rank,"
and you're watching <i>just the artifacts</i>
at the legendary once lost temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>
I have just braved a treacherous climb
to the temple's harrowing heights to bring you this...
The snake talisman.
Liar! Liar! Liar!
Ow! That hurt!
Edit that out.
Where did this mysterious talisman come from?
Why was it here?
And what is that awful racket?
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Jade!
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Yaaa!
Everything all right?
Maybe a sprain.
I meant the camera!
"Now, point it at that exit."
Let's wrap this up.
Ohh! Uh...
Ohh...
"Jackie, are you ok?"
"Oh, I will be"
after a week in traction.
"And with this phenomenal find firmly in hand,"
this is Wesley rank bidding you farewell
till next time on <i> just the artifacts.</i>
Daah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Let me guess. Edit that out?
"Seor gigante, I presume?"
Oh! Why's he looking at me?
"Because it is the guardian of the temple,"
and <i> you</i> have the talisman.
Yaaa!
I don't want it.
Here!
"Careful, Jackie. It's thropwing a hissy!"
I get it. It can't bite us up here.
It can't bite you up there!
Whoaa!
Uhh! Oh! Oh!
Ohh...
Jackie! Use the talisman!
"We don't know what power it has, too dangerous."
"Tch, like jumbo the snake's not?"
Crikey! I didn't tell you to film that!
Hello... I'm blinding it.
Snakes don't have eyelids.
Aaah!
"Jackie, climb up!"
Me first. Me first.
You next.
"Doesn't want me, man."
Hyah!
Uhh!
Throw me the vine.
Throw me the talisman.
Thank you.
The vine!
Nice guy.
(Growls)
Come on! Come on!
The network's gonna love this.
Aah!
(Nervous mumbling)
(Panting)
Sleazo took off with the talisman.
"(Humming) Get out of here, on my way--"
the talisman.
Yaa! - Yaa! Yaa!
No sign of the flying monkeys.
Rats with wings.
I'll take the bats.
(Grunting)
"Heh. It's all yours, mate."
Uh-oh.
Aah!
Oh...
Uh-oh. - Uh-oh.
Jade! Go! Go! Go!
Ooff! - Oof!
Why are you still here?
"Uh, camera guy was right. I'm a jerk."
I couldn't leave without apologizing--
not now!
Run!
Aaaah!
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Oh-ohh...
Gotcha. - Aah!
Aah! Aah! - Aah!
Waaah!
(Coughing)
Waaah!
Incoming!
Belly flop!
Ow! Ow! Piranha!
Oh. I hate piranha. Ow. Ow.
"(Sighs) Adios, culebra."
The only snake I ever want to see after this is the snake talisman.
Huh? It's gone!
Rank.
What a snake!
"Welcome. I'm Wesley rank,"
and you're watching <i>just the artifacts</i>
at the legendary once lost temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>
I have just braved a treacherous climb
to the temple's harrowing heights to bring you this...
The snake talisman.
I'm on TV!
Rank didn't edit that out?
Liar! Liar! Liar!
Ow! That hurt.
Aah! Aah! Aah! (Sobbing)
Welcome to a special edition of <i> just the artifacts.</i>
"Wesley rank may not know how to treat little girls,"
but he sure knows how to scream like one.
"Ha ha ha ha. I'm dino stefanson,"
and I'll be your new guide.
"Go, camera guy."
Look!
You'll also get the full scoop
on how we recovered this rare snake talisman
from a local pawn shop rank sold it to.
"We, of course, donated the artifact to the New York museum."
"(Sigh) After what we've been through,"
getting the talisman from the museum should be a snap.
We're off to the jungle.
"New York, the concrete jungle. Duh."
"Man: Hey, Jackie. - Yes."
Have you ever worked with any dangerous animals?
Lion. Lion. Yes. In Africa.
Small--small lion.
"I picked up the lion, hi, hi, hi."
"But the native, the small-- the native, aah! Aah! Aah!"
"I said, what? What?"
But the mom come behind me.
"Then I run, climb up to the tree."
"The lion, grr, grr, grr!"
Almost touch my feet.
"Remember, lion can climb up to the tree."
"Please, Jackie? I need it for school."
Mm-mmm.
"Nobody believes me about the talismans,"
but if I show them some super-rabbit speed...
"A talisman is not a toy, Jade."
"Come on, Jackie. You were a kid once."
Didn't you ever want to be the big chan on campus?
"Yes, I did."
And this is the scar I have to show for it.
"I don't want you getting hurt, too."
So no showing off.
"But as long as I don't show off,"
"I can still borrow it, right?"
See you after school. Bye!
Jackie'll never even notice it's--
Jackie: Jade? Jade!
Whah!
"Jade, did you just - intercept my chronoton beam?"
"Me, kepler?"
No.
Can't have you disrupting the time continuum.
Heh heh.
Baah! - There you are.
You forgot your lunch.
Heh! Thanks.
Whew! And she's safe.
Ah! I wish we hadn't lost that speed talisman.
I wish chan was never born.
I wish one of them talismans
would come to us for a change.
¶ Boom chicka-chicka boom-boom chicka-chicka ¶
¶ boom uhh ¶
I wish I had a million bucks.
¶ Boom chicka-chicka ¶
¶ boom-boom chicka-chicka boom ¶
(gasps) I'm late!
(All grumble)
Sparks? Since when are there...
Whoa.
Aaaaaaaah!
Uhh!
Ok...
That was weird.
"Hey, miss hartman, sorry I'm--"
ha ha ha ha ha!
<i>What</i> are you wearing?
Ahem.
"Are you in the right classroom, young lady?"
"Miss hartman, it's me."
Jade chan. Nice do.
Chan. Of course.
"Class, Jade is the new student we've been expecting."
I am?
"Now, let's start with current events."
Who watched president Carter's speech on TV--
new student? Bell-bottoms?
President who?
What is going-- (Gasps)
1976?
I'm not late for class. I'm early. Way early.
I'm sorry I'm late.
"I'm your new student, Jackie chan."
No way.
Another chan?
Are you two related?
B-b-b-bathroom.
What did you do?
"You're the speed talisman,"
not the talisman- that-sends-you-back- in-time talisman.
The beam.
Kepler said I was messing with the time something-uum.
"Well, whatever you did, I'm gonna reverse it, fast."
Hmm?
Rrrrr!
Come oooooon!
"Pet rocks, mood rings."
"Get 'em while they're now, baby."
Ohh...I'm stuck in the seventies.
"So, she speeds off, and then, zappo-- she's gone."
"It was freaky, big v,"
left behind some kind of energy hole.
Energy hole? Zappo?
"A crude description, valmont."
But I indeed sense a wrinkle in time.
The child has used the speed talisman
to forge a tunnel to the past.
"And if shendu's rabbit dug a hole,"
all you idiots have to do to secure the talisman
is go through that hole.
But tunnels through time flow only in one direction.
"If you wish them to return,"
they will require this.
"So, uh, just how far back does this tunnel thingy go?"
We talking dinosaurs?
"I don't care if it leads to the big bang, you buffoons!"
Just bring me that talisman.
(Telephone rings) Hello?
"Jackie, you are a terrible guardian!"
Uncle?
Jade's teacher phoned.
She is skipping school.
One more thing: These kinds of things
never happened when I was raising you!
They certainly didn't.
"Kepler, have you seen Jade--aah!"
Same beam almost fried Jade.
Maybe I should move the emitter.
Uhh! Maybe? This is a safety hazard!
My chronoton beam is not a hazard.
"If anyone were to be exposed,"
this scanner would reveal...
A trail of particles...
Leading out of the lab.
And straight to Jade.
Bell-bottoms. Uck!
That's so nineties!
"I got to find a way home, fast!"
Can not!
Can so!
Can not. Nobody can jump this fence.
It's too tall.
I can. Watch.
Hyuh...Aah-- - gotcha!
Whoa! Ohh!
Where did you come from?
Ha ha!
Evel knievel wannabe.
Both: Ha ha ha ha ha!
You ok?
"Didn't hurt yourself, did you?"
I'm just very embarrassed.
My scar...
What scar?
Exactly.
I really will be able to jump that fence someday.
"Oh, I believe you."
I'm learning kung fu.
My parents sent me to America
so I can train with my uncle.
Uncle! Why didn't I think of that?
Whoa! - Come on!
I don't know about this.
Enter.
No way! There could be raptors or t-rexes.
I'm not your Guinea piiiii--
"if there are dinosaurs,"
they will be busy eating Finn.
Whoa!
(All shout)
Ow! Oof!
Finn: Get down.
Get funky.
It's the seventies.
The talisman is near.
(Gasps)
How did you know where I live?
Whoa! What are these?
8-track tapes.
But where are the antiques?
"While I wish to trade in ancient treasures,"
8-track is the wave of the future.
How did you know about antiques?
"Because I'm Jade chan, your niece,"
and I need your expert magic advice!
Magic?
Oh...Guess you don't study with chi master fong
for another few years.
The talisman.
"Shouldn't you guys be, like, 9 years old?"
"Jackie, go to your room."
"Whoa. It's chan, but bite-size."
And if we off him when he's little...
He'll never get big.
Destroy him.
(Gasps)
Bad day.
All: Rrrah!
Hyuh!
Ahh...Hyuh!
Hyoo-wuh!
Huhh!
Whoa. Jackie gets it all from uncle.
Of course I do. He trains me.
Hyah-ha! Whoa.
Run!
Wah...Haa!
You will pay for that!
All: Ow! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Hey!
What's that?
My lucky rabbit's foot.
The talisman.
Sorry. We'll bring them back. Thank you!
What are you doing--aah!
Jackie: Bwaaah!
(All sigh)
What are we gonna do?
"If we go back empty-handed,"
valmont's gonna freak.
Ooh! Valmont! He'd know what to do.
Let's find him and ask him.
Earth to ratso. It's 1976.
"Valmont is a kid, a British kid."
He's not gonna be in San Francisco.
Bingo.
What do <i> you</i> buffoons want?
"Wow. That's him, all right."
What are you doing in America?
"(Scoffs) I'm an exchange student,"
and I won't be harassed
by American salesmen.
Who sent you people?
"Uh, you did."
"See, it's like this, little v."
We're not salesmen. We're from the future.
Impossible.
My particles couldn't make a wormhole
unless Jade was moving at unthinkable speed.
But this is definitely a bridge in the time continuum.
"Jade's either in the future, or she's..."
In the past!
"My scar! Oh, Jade's changing the past,"
my past!
Careful. One-way trip.
"But if Jade's in the past,"
the future could be in big trouble.
"Slow down! Please, slow down!"
Think we ditched 'em.
Ditched who? Why are those men after me?
What's that rabbit thing? How can you run so fast?
What's going on?
Ok. Here's the deal.
I'm from the future. You're my uncle.
The talisman's magic. The dark hand is after it.
And now they want to get rid of you
so they won't have to fight you when you grow up.
Get it?
"That's crazy, Jade."
You're crazy.
Do I really grow up to be a criminal mastermind?
Uh-huh.
"Well, then, I say we kidnap the old man"
and use a ransom note to lure this chan into an ambush.
"Uh, that's the plan you used the first time we met chan."
And it didn't work then.
Then might I suggest you leave him...
To me.
Sir! Come quickly! Your nephew needs help!
Jackie?
Where is he?
Uhh...Ohh...
My first act of mega-villainy.
This is exhilarating.
Coast is clear. Come on.
Uncle's probably worried sick.
Jackie: Hello? Uncle? Hello?
(Gasps) The dark hand's got uncle!
We have to rescue him.
<i>I</i> have to rescue him.
"If they get their hands on you,"
it'll mess up the future.
"And if uncle is harmed, it will mess up my future."
Jade! Jade?
Oh! The dark hand's got uncle!
What are they doing here?
Mmm...Mmm...Mmm...
Mmm...
"So, uh, what if your host parents"
"come home, little big v?"
I will simply assure them
this is all part of some sort of
social studies project for school.
Hey!
Ooh!
Hwuh! Uhh!
Argh! Gah! - Eeg!
Unh! Uhh!
Raarrr!
Mmm-mmm!
Whoa!
Bah-hah!
Whew!
What's with the crystal ball?
"I'm coming, uncle!"
Jade: Jackie!
Ohh!
"Ready to rewrite history, little chan?"
Noooooooo....
(Blubbers) Help! Help!
Jackie hasn't learned how to swim yet?
"Hang on, Jack--"
the talisman.
Unh! Let go!
"(Chokes, sputters)"
(Pants)
Oh! Oh...
Bad day.
(Chokes)
(Choking)
Oh! Let me go! Uhh!
Hand over the talisman.
Fetch!
Jackie! Say something!
(Coughs)
(Gasps)
That'll do.
How come no one invited me...
To the pool party?
How 'bout we just go home
with the talisman?
Valmont: You can't leave me!
I'm your boss!
You got to be kidding me.
The talisman. It's magic.
"Uh-huh. Give me a hand, Jackie."
Coming. - Coming.
Aah! - Aah!
Bah! - Bah!
Are you... Are you...
You are! You are!
"I have to break up the lovefest,"
but the bad guys said they're going home!
Which means they can go home.
Must be that crystal ball thing.
You mean this?
I took it from the man who grabbed me.
"I'm telling you, I didn't lose it!"
"Lose what, you buffoons?"
Jade: This.
Rrrrrr!
Ooh-hoo!
Ooh.
(Kids chatter)
Give me that!
Hyah-gaah!
Everybody - is kung fu fighting.
Hyuh!
Hyuh! Uhh! Uhh!
(Kids cheer)
¶ I got the boogie fever ¶
"¶ uh, uh ¶"
¶ I got the fever ¶
"¶ I, uh, got the fever ¶"
(kids cheer)
Where'd tohru go with the--
(gasps) Jackie!
I can see the future.
Huh?
Wet willies!
Ooh!
"Big me, catch!"
Tohru: Chan!
Get off me!
"The crystal, or you'll have an unhappy childhood."
"Let him go, or he will, too!"
Do as he says. Please.
"Hold it. Chan wouldn't hurt a kid,"
not even mini-valmont.
Ohh...
Jackie wouldn't...
But I would!
"Do it, and no one leaves."
No!
(Gasps)
Wait!
Uh-oh.
We'll be stranded!
(Kids cheer)
But I don't want to go back! I don't want to go back!
"You may have won today, chan."
"But we will meet again, and--"
hyah!
Aah!
"Jackie, it looks like you'll have"
a very interesting future.
With a very odd niece.
One more thing: Did she say anything else
about my future in antiques?
Uhh! Unh! Grr-grr!
Uh-oh.
The old days.
Time continuum's good as new.
But I still can't figure out
how you made a wormhole
without going supersonic.
I did go supersonic.
"See, the rabbit talisman has magic powers, and--"
(chuckles) Magic powers.
"I'll prove it! Hey, Jackie, can I borrow the--"
heh. Never mind.
What is taking them so long?
"(Old man's voice) Yo, big v."
"We, uh, took the long way home."
"So, uh,"
"you can change us back, right?"
"Interviewer: Hey, Jackie..."
Were you cool when you were a kid?
All the kids in the school-- they didn't like me.
"I remember we testing,"
"uh, the skill in the school."
"One by one, you'd do a somersault,"
do different tricks to pass the test.
They all push me.
They go first. They go first.
I'm the last one. What I'm gonna do?
Everybody do somersault--shoo!
Shoo! Shoo!
"I go out, I do one somersault like this."
That low. My nose just touch the ground.
"Then the teacher, ""oh, good."""
"So, I think, ""I'm cool."""
Unh!
Unh.
Unh!
Unh! Unh!
"<i>Sayonara,</i> chumps."
Hiyah!
Jade?
Now can I join the j-team?
Well...
But I mopped the floor with ninja butt.
El solo me-o! Yipe!
No!
Where are you taking me?
Jade!
No. Not here.
Not yet.
"Nice of you to join us, Jade."
Would you care to read your essay to the class?
Essay?
Aah!
(Gasping)
5 more shopping days
till the end of Summer vacation.
Yay.
"Jackie, I keep having the same weird dream."
I show up to the first day of class
"without my ""what I did during Summer vacation"" essay."
"Gee, perhaps you should start writing your essay."
"Tch. You mean, write about how boring vacation's been?"
We haven't seen a single demon or ninja or dark hand thug.
Mmm. My kind of Summer.
Black: Jackie.
Could I see you a moment?
"Aye, cap'n!"
Funny. I did not hear him say <i> your</i> name.
It involves Jade.
That would be moi.
What did she do?
Not Jade the niece. Jade the stone.
"Jackie: Oh, I recognize these pieces."
Some of the finest examples of emperor's Jade
ever to exist.
Until they vanished.
"As you know, the collections"
of nearly a dozen Chinese museums
"have been hit over the last decade,"
and the thefts have the same thing in common.
"No prints, no tracks, no suspects."
Until now.
Section 13 agents have been tracking the movements
of taiwanese billionaire Bartholomew Chang.
His hand...
Made of Jade.
(Door opens)
You rang?
Both: The stone.
Just checking.
Our biggest obstacle is diplomatic.
The taiwanese government believes Chang
to be its greatest philanthropist.
That's why we can't make a move on his island fortress
without absolute proof that he's stockpiling the goods there.
And I can help you how?
Chang is about to host
his annual exclusive martial arts tournament
ostensibly for charity.
But I believe Chang uses the tournament as an audition
"to recruit muscle for his private army,"
and the guest transportation
as a means to smuggle Jade
onto the island and off of it.
Ah. You want me to attend the tournament
as a contestant?
And find the...
(Whispers) Jade.
"Captain black, no offense,"
but this is way out of Jackie's league.
This is a job for...
The j-team!
"El toro fuerte, wrestler extraordinaire."
"Viper, mistress of hapkido, pilates, and krav maga."
"Tohru, the big, strong..."
"Er, sumo."
"Uh, yes. Captain black,"
I am sorry that my niece has
such an active imagination.
"I like it. Good work, kid."
Tohru: Sumo?
But I am small for a sumo.
"Well, you'll just have to eat more."
All part of the training.
"All right, t.,"
assume the position.
Unh. Unh.
Rrrr!
Unh.
Unh.
Unh!
"Now, the name of the game"
"is to stay in the ring, <i>capiche?</i>"
Unh.
Hiyah!
Unh!
(Gasps)
Earthquake!
You are very small for a sumo.
Lesson number one: Think big.
Thank you all for coming
and for accepting this mission.
I've taken the Liberty
of assigning each of you a code name.
Hepcat.
Slippery McGee.
Fearless hyena.
The big bopper.
And you can call me...
When we get there
to let you know we arrived safely.
But this was my idea.
The mission was gonna be my perfect Summer getaway.
"If I don't go, paco doesn't go."
"Paco <i> is</i> going, right?"
Too dangerous.
"Besides, he is busy writing his"
"""what I did for Summer vacation"" essay."
"Sorry, kiddo,"
but let's you and me go rollerblading
as soon as I get back.
"Sure thing, hepcat."
You're a real master of disguise.
El toro fuerte never removes his mask.
Wish I could remove these pajamas.
Not used to such a roomy fit.
"According - to captain black,"
Chang gives a private tour of his operations
to all tournament winners.
That would be the safest way to gain access to the Jade.
(Fanfare plays)
"Ready to go for the gold, big bopper?"
Oh!
Jade! How did you--
captain black said the boats were used
"to smuggle Jade onto the island, duh."
"Ah! Not the niece, the stone!"
Let the tournament begin.
"Jujitsu contestants,"
approach the competition stage.
"Senor fuerte, you're on."
How do you know?
Tch. Who'd you think
was gonna register you guys for your bouts?
(Grunting)
Yes!
An intriguing derivation of jujitsu.
Aaahhh!
"Oh, no! The ""bounce-off- the-ropes"" maneuver!"
What ropes?
Uh-oh.
All: Aah!
(Groans)
The champion.
"This ain't <i> lucha libre,</i> àhandsome."
"Ah, force of habit."
"Iron fist contestants,"
approach the competition stage.
"Show 'em who's boss, fearless hyena."
(Grunting)
What?
Why did you sign me up for that?
"Hello? ""Greatest victory, battle not fought."""
Thought you liked to avoid hand-to-hand combat.
"How did Chang lose his hand, anyway?"
Iron fist competition.
Heh heh. Bricks.
Owww!
"Well, Jackie's out."
Not quite.
Best 2 out of 3.
"Taibo: Contestants, approach the competition stage."
Viper's gonna rock the tournament.
Hiyah!
The champion.
This clown suit's really cramping my style.
"Sumo contestants, approach the competition stage."
"It's up to you, t."
Think big. Think big.
Think big. Think big. Think big. Think big.
Think big.
Think...
Big.
"Hello, tiny."
(Gulps) Yeah.
Jade: Think big.
Huh?
Aaarrrgh!
Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa."
Whoa!
The champion!
"Tohru, you da bomb."
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I won?
I won!
(Knock on door)
Yes?
"Uh, mmm. Good evening,"
"uh, Mr. referee."
Taibo: Master Chang requests your presence.
Chang has summoned tohru.
Jade will be pleased to hear this.
"No. Jade, eh,"
Jade will be pleased to remain in her room.
(Footsteps approaching)
Sumo.
You fought like a warrior today.
"Uh, I--I have an excellent trainer."
"Chang enterprises can compensate you beyond your wildest dreams,"
if you dedicate yourself to serving my empire.
Yes.
Very well.
(Beeping)
"Champion, join the privileged few."
Heh heh. Hello.
Now behold...
One of my most successful ventures.
Quilts.
All proceeds go to charity.
Anything?
Song and dance.
Chang won't show his true colors
until he's certain he can trust tohru.
Chang: Cookies.
All proceeds go to charity.
Yummy?
(Yawns)
Shh.
Jade.
Tohru has a visual.
"Er, the niece, not the stone."
I have to get her out of there.
You'll jeopardize the mission.
And Jade won't?
50-50.
Jade!
Hey! Hiyah!
Huh?
(Beeping)
(Gasps)
Jade!
"And over here,"
the pride and Joy of Chang enterprises...
Basket weaving.
All proceeds go...
You! Aah!
This area is off limits.
What are you doing?
Looking for Jade.
What Jade? There is no Jade here.
I see no Jade.
"Oh, no, no, no, no. Jade, my niece,"
not Jade the stone.
"Uh, have you seen it--"
"uh--uh, I mean, her?"
"No? Well, it was very nice seeing you again."
"Uh, thank you. Bye-bye."
Are you certain you wish to serve me?
"Of course, master Chang."
"Then prove yourself, sumo."
Bury our intruder.
(Gasps)
"Heh heh, nice sumo."
Unh! Aah!
All: Unh!
(All groan)
That was the best plan you could come up with?
Yes.
This way!
Jade?
The niece or the stone?
My Jade!
Destroy them!
El toro: Not so fast.
You were gonna start the party without us?
Rematch.
Watch the hands. Please! Not the hands!
I win.
Not the hands.
"Ropes, <i> por favor.</i>"
Not the hands.
<i>Amigo!</i> Tag team!
Owww!
Sorry.
(Whistle)
You!
(Gulps)
I have never lost a match
until today.
We humble ourselves before you.
Let us even the odds.
Destroy them!
(All yelling)
"You can run, Chang,"
but you can't hide from the j-team.
Jackie could use some helping hands.
Jade: Jackie!
Heh. Always brush after soup?
Aah!
(Gagging)
Unh!
Unh.
The champion!
(All groaning)
Thinking big?
Livin' large.
"Team, I hope you'll consider"
joining us for future missions.
"Mmm, well..."
Both: We would be honored.
"So this makes me official, right?"
"Well, let's just say the ""j"" in j-team"
"stands for more than ""Jackie."""
And that's what I did
on my mondo coolio Summer vacation.
"Hey, Jackie, what is rushu?"
It's a little art.
It's like a dancing.
"Like me, when I'm playing badminton."
"Choo, ooh, ooh."
We're doing this kind of things. You have your own style.
"You learn something from me, ok,"
but later on you must have your own style.
Yeah.
"And now that I'm finally rid of that pestilent lizard shendu,"
the dark hand will rise agai--
"uh, valmont?"
Your pancakes are gettin' cold.
Mmhh. Mmm. Mmhh.
"Speaking of temperature,"
we shall need to acquire some serious heat
if we're to embark on our epic crime spree.
"Now you're talkin', big v."
"So, what's the plan?"
You three will break into section 13
and steal the talismans.
Whoa! Again?!
"Uh, bustin' into section 13's kinda risky."
"Besides, v, we don't do flunky work anymore."
Not unless we're gettin' paid.
Uh...True...
This demon nonsense has depleted dark hand finances...
But you know I'm good for it.
"Ok, but you gotta make us partners."
Call yourselves vice presidents if you wish.
Just bring me those talismans!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What? I didn't eat.
(Thunder)
Darkness shall begin its reign.
(Snoring) Huh?
Huh? Huh? What? Hmm?
Uh...Sensei. What is it?
Uncle has the willies.
(Beeping)
(Sighs) Some herbal tea to lull me to sleep.
"Hey, Jackie! Uhh!"
Oh! Jade!
You should be asleep.
So should you. And I know just the thing
to help you unwind.
First we strap on rollerblades
and set up trash-can goalposts.
Then we slip a few talismans out of the vault.
Just because I can't sleep
doesn't mean you don't have to.
I am near.
How did you get in here?
Freeze!
Whoa! Mmhh! Mmph!
Daolon: The talismans of shendu...
So close I can feel the 12 powers
of the Chinese zodiac.
(Thud)
Shh!
Sweet. No guards in sight.
Shh! Shh!
"Man, security here stinks!"
Shh! Shh!
I told you - security here stinks.
5...6...
7...
Guards must be on coffee break.
And monkey makes 12.
Oomp!
<i>We'll</i> take those!
"Who are you, anyway?"
"Ooh, ooh, I know."
He's the drummer from kiss.
All: Whoa!
Who are you?
(Gasps)
The dark hand! Daolon wong!
"Uh, daolon wong, the dark hand."
Jackie!
Aah!
Jade?
They have the talismans!
Who?
Score.
You gotta be kidding me.
Gan! Ren! Chui!
Where'd they come from?
Be cool. Be cool.
All: Chan!
Retrieve the talismans.
What he said.
Jackie!
All: Whoo!
"Ooh, daddy like."
The child!
All: Huh?
(Chanting)
Tohru! Now!
"Go, uncle!"
My warriors...
Imprisoned?
How did you locate the lost urn of wei Cheng?
I know a thing or 2 about antiques.
Keep the warriors. Aiyaa!
Both: Uncle!
I will take the talismans.
"Ready, aim..."
Vaporize.
Waa! Whoop!
She's got 'em!
Both: Ooh! Unh!
Jade: Jackie!
Jackie!
You must not let daolon wong have the talismans!
Ok. No one will have them.
Ratso: They're gonna blow!
Uh-oh.
"Oh, well."
Ah.
"Jackie, you blew 'em up."
(Sighs) It is finally over.
Ow!
Not over.
It is just beginning.
It is?
"Talismans - can be destroyed,"
but the powers they contain cannot.
"The magic has been set free,"
scattered to the winds.
Which means daolon wong will try to find them.
"You mean, Jackie just started the talisman hunt"
all over again? Cool.
Unh! But where did the magic go?
"With no vessels to contain them,"
"the powers will return to their owners,"
the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.
Hello. The Chinese zodiac is way ancient.
Those animals are history.
"As such, the talisman magic"
will be drawn to noble animals:
Those most worthy - of their regal ancestors.
12 living creatures
each about to receive an extraordinary gift.
What have I done?!
Do not just stand there! Get cracking!
Uncle: You must locate each animal
before its power can be claimed
by the forces of darkness.
Jackie.
What's going on?
More than you can possibly imagine.
Well?!
Uh...
That thing about making us partners?
don't worry about it.
"If I were employing you, I would <i> fire</i> you!"
You three...
I require your assistance.
So...What's the gig pay?
(Chanting)
Aah! Aah! Aah!
You're orange.
You're bald.
Freaky.
"Bow before me, dark chi warriors."
Finn don't bow to no--
uh...Ow!
Whoa! Hey!
"You are no longer mortal men,"
but powerful servants enslaved to do my bidding.
"Now, see here!"
"Finn, ratso, and chow are <i> my</i> servants,"
and I will thank you not to--
aaah! Hey!
"Ahh, it would seem good fortune is mine,"
for one - of the talisman's powers remains near.
"Come, my warriors!"
Are we supposed to--
wait!
You can't just leave me here!
Release me at once!
(Chanting)
"Any sign of daolon, uncle?"
I thought we were looking for animals.
Sensei says each animal requires
"a different locator spell to lead us to it,"
"but we do not have time to research them all,"
with daolon on the loose.
"Oh, we are getting something."
It's...A woman.
She's got soap.
My mastery of spells is no match for daolon's.
Wait! There's more.
Jackie: It looks like daolon is going to...
A dog show?! A dog show?!
Daolon has located the power of immortality.
(Arf)
Oh! That stray is harassing my Jasper-wasper.
Security!
Which is the beast that I seek?
"If I destroy all of them, one would remain standing..."
The one which holds
the power of immortality.
"Jackie, the power of immortality resides"
in one of the dogs!
But which one?
Oh! Jackie!
Huh?
Hyah!
Quickly! We must take the dog where daolon's magic cannot reach!
"But <i> which</i> dog, uncle?"
Were you not listening?!
The most noble one!
But--oh!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
"Giddyup! Get along, little doggies."
(Arf)
Gan! Ren! Chui!
Whoa.
There is something different about them.
They got - a dark chi makeover.
"Warriors, get them!"
"Get along, little doggies!"
"You can trap the dark hand guys in another urn, right?"
"There is only one urn of wei Cheng,"
and it is already occupied!
I am so buff!
"Hey, we can fly!"
Groovy!
Run!
Tohru. Whoa.
"Hey, buddy."
Whoa.
Sweet.
Score!
Attack!
(Roar)
Good dogs. <i> Good</i> dogs.
Whoa! Bad dogs!
Bad dogs! Bad dogs! Bad dogs! Bad dogs!
Whoa!
Aah!
Stay.
"Face it, tohru."
You're no match for...Uh...
Whatever we are!
No.
No.
"Hiya, scruffy."
Good boy. Good boy.
"Uncle, walk the dogs."
Whoa! Aah!
Scruffy!
"Mongrel, be gone!"
(Gasps)
The immortal.
That is the noble dog we have been looking for?
"Jade, shoo."
Aww!
Scruffy!
Surrender your power to the forces of--
(arf!)
Aah!
"Scruffy! Here, boy!"
"Aw, cute."
Too bad you gotta hand him over.
Jackie!
Hey!
Chan!
My hammer!
Hunh!
Huh?
No way.
Guys! Check it out!
Remote control.
Rock 'n' roll.
Bwaah!
(Chuckling)
It's like playin' a video game.
(Uncle chanting)
"I may be an old dog,"
but I have new tricks.
"Whoa, down, boy."
"Can we keep him, Jackie, please?!"
Uh...
Of course we keep him.
Yay!
"Go get it, boy."
"Until uncle can transfer the power into a new vessel,"
the dog is a living talisman.
"The little fella really should stay where it's safe, Jackie."
But section 13 isn't safe.
Daolon already penetrated security once.
Magic defeats magic.
A good chi spell will keep daolon and his warriors out.
One more thing. Ow!
Get cracking!
You have 11 more animals to locate.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie..."
Yes?
What do you do to stay in shape?
"Basically training with my stunt guy,"
"with my students, 3 hours a day."
Also boxing-- the rhythm--
bam bam bam bam.
"Lift weights, badminton school,"
"jogging, ping-pong."
Move your whole body.
Training is very important. Yes.
"Hey, mahoney, what is that?"
Some kind of monkey puppet.
"""To free me of glitches"
"""and put you in stitches,"
"""this merry ape begs"
"pull my leg."""
(Evil laugh)
The monkey king is back!
Mucho thanko for the leggo yanko.
Mahoney?
Wax him up once a week to keep his shine up.
"Now tell me,"
"man to mandrill,"
know where I can find these two?
Who are they?
(Manic cry)
They are the ones who chucked me back to woodville
and tried to cement my fate.
"Me,"
the maharaja of monkeyshines!
But the last laugh will be on them...
'Cause it's payback time!
(Evil laugh)
"Uncle: A little bit more to the left, tohru."
Now raise your right leg.
Hot-cha!
Uncle has reception!
The monkey talisman.
Its power.
You destroyed the talismans.
Now let us hope this locator spell
will reveal the whereabouts
"of the animal who possesses this power,"
before the forces of darkness can find it.
(Chanting)
Aha!
The signal is strong.
Hmm...
Interference.
Tohru!
"I have not moved, sensei."
What?
Whoa!
Daolon wong!
(Hisses) You are in my soup!
Our locator spells have intersected.
"I will seize control of the chi waves, novice."
My power is far greater than--
eeeeeeee!
One more thing:
(Blows raspberry)
One more thing:
(Blows raspberry) One more thing:
Urghhh!
"I have blocked daolon wong's access to our chi wavelength,"
but I do not know for how long.
Hopefully long enough for us to beat daolon to...
Hawaii?
That is where we will find the noble monkey
who now holds the power of shapeshifting.
Uncle: We must leave immediately!
(Straining) Shall I stay and watch the shop?
Sensei?
( <i> Helmut and ulf theme</i> àplaying)
(Humming)
(Groans)
Uhh!
Uuuuhhhh!
"Sumo, ho!"
(Gasps) Not you again.
"Tell me where your pals are, puny,"
or I'll harpoon a whale!
"Uh, they're gone, uh, far away."
How far?
They did not say.
(Imitates buzzer) Wrong answer!
(Gong)
(Laughs) That was not funny.
Huh? I don't amuse you?
Not funny? Not funny?
I'm the grand pooh-bah of ha-ha!
"Tell me where I can find your pals,"
"or I'll show you ""not funny."""
Nurse.
"Oh, please,"
anything but that.
"No, no, no, no!"
No!
No!
(Crazed laughter)
"Uncle,"
I am beginning to feel foolish.
Monkeys are not even indigenous to Hawaii.
"And if the monkey has the shapeshifter power,"
how do we know it's even a monkey anymore?
Why do you both question uncle?!
"To find the monkey in any shape or form,"
you must feel the power within the peel.
But I do not feel any powerrrr--
brakes!
Brakes!
Hello.
Status report?
I do not think he is a monkey.
Ahem. I am ambassador shimizu of Japan.
(Monkey squeaks)
<i>This</i> is a monkey.
Cute!
"Thank the nice man for the banana, haiku."
(Belches)
"Uh, Mr. ambassador, sir,"
"it is, uh, vital that we take possession of your pet."
What? Haiku is a very rare breed from hokkaido.
Mm-hmm. Noble.
"Uh, yes, uh,"
that is why some very bad men are after him.
Jackie!
(Gasps)
Aiyaa!
Who ate my locator spell?!
Oh.
Wha?
Did we say monkey? We meant pigeon.
Oh!
Jackie!
Monkey's flying away!
Haiku?
How will we know which one is haiku?
Duh.
(Kissing)
Birdy want a banana?
Got you!
Whoa!
Got--
(chuckles) Hello.
"Jackie, I had him eating out of my hand."
Ee! Ow! Oh!
Oh! Ee! Oh!
don't take it personally.
Haiku doesn't know you're trying to help.
No offense--
ow!...Taken
perhaps we should find a way to communicate with the beast.
"How? Haiku doesn't speak English,"
and we don't speak monkey.
No problem!
I just happen to be bilingual!
(Evil laugh)
"Nice chimp,"
but why settle for second banana when...
The king is back!
(Imitating Elvis) ¶ uh-huh ¶
thank you very much.
Monkey talisman and monkey king?
Co-inki-dink?
(Gasps)
Forget monkey king.
We must catch monkey magic before daolon wong does.
¶ Uh-huh ¶
oh!
Leaving so soon?
"(Chuckles) How have you been, uh, Mr. king?"
And how did you know where to find us?
Let's just say someone you know ratted you out.
Uhh! Aah!
Stop! Stop! Oh!
Please! Please! Make it stop!
"Um, and you went to all the trouble to see us...Why?"
"Let's see, maybe,"
"oh, a little something I like to call..."
<i>Revenge!</i>
"So, you want a piece of uncle?"
Haiku.
"Come here, boy. Come on."
(Gasps)
(Tires screech)
Ohh!
Where's a banana when you need one?
(Chanting)
Huh?
(Hums Beethoven's 5th death knocking Melody)
Uhh! Uhh! No! Uhh!
Dwaaah!
Uhh!
"Uh, you know, uh,"
"this isn't a very humorous revenge for ""the king of comedy."""
Sweet simpering simian!
You have a point!
We're going to laugh it up at a luau.
Ahem!
For the main course...
Hams a la chan!
"(Imitating Groucho Marx) With a little tenderizer for the old bird, of course."
And for the entertainment...
My tribute-to-pele fire dance.
(Chanting in native language)
Uh...
"It's all right, folks."
All part of the show.
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
Get 'em while they're hot!
Haiku.
(Blowing)
Ole!
(Groaning)
"And aloha, chuckles."
Oop!
(All gasp)
Hot! Hot! Hot!
"Hang on, uncs! Uhh!"
Jade! The monkey!
Right!
(All gasp)
(Applause)
(Spits)
Where's the little matador?
Bingo!
But who's bongo?
Uh...
<i>Mahalo.</i> And...
don't forget to tip your waitresses.
(Gasps)
Time I buried <i>you</i> in cement!
(Gasps)
(Roar)
(Cheers and applause)
That upstart's stealing my shtick!
"Aw, he's nothing, folks."
"If you want entertainment, get a load of me!"
"I do animals, too."
(Whinnies)
Ta-da!
(Chirping)
(Chirping)
Wise guy!
(Cheers and applause)
Jade.
(tarzan yell)
(Gasps) (Gasps)
"Sorry, gang,"
"but before I destroy you,"
I'm going to destroy the thing you love most!
(Evil laugh)
Anchors aweigh!
"Monkeys can't swim, can they?"
(Evil laugh)
(Evil laugh)
Wait here!
I'm sorry. I'll bring it back.
Thank you!
"Sayonara, sea monkey."
(Cheers)
Release him!
Monkey king: Go fish!
Hey!
That was a figure of speech!
Uhh!
Uuuhhhhh!
"Chim-chim's got a hot date,"
and you've got a burial at sea!
(Evil laugh)
Ooohhh! Oh!
Bad wave! Bad wave! Bad wave! Bad waaaavvve!
Rad!
(Groans)
Cowabunga.
Where's haiku?
Jade: - The kilauea volcano.
Uh-oh. My simian senses are tingling.
"We want our monkey, monkey."
"Oh, it's all about <i>him,</i> isn't it?!"
"You think he's funnier than me, don't you?"
"Uh, of course not."
Everyone knows that the monkey king
is the funniest ape of all.
I do not think he's so funny.
"Well, you'll <i> really</i> love my <i> weird</i> sense of humor"
"when you and monkeyboy are swimming in lava,"
'cause I'm going to make kilauea blow sky-high.
The monkey king cannot activate volcanoes.
"Just watch me, gramps."
I know a family recipe.
"""Magic monkey syrup, pure cane sugar,"
"one carton of aged goat milk--"" yeech!"
"""An untuned Hawaiian guitar,"
"""a fine-tuned tuning fork,"
"a tuna on rye, hold the Mayo--"""
"talismon power, be mine!"
"Paws off the fur, Shakespeare!"
I'm busy here!
Huh?
Ah...
That is the monkey I seek.
"Soon to be monkey toast,"
along with his pals.
Jackie!
Give me that!
And to the winner...
Uhh!
And to the loser--
uhh!
Uhh!
Never thought I'd be rooting for daolon wong over anybody.
Come on!
All: Oh!
"On second thought, go, monkey king."
Monkey king?
(Groaning)
"Ah, I should have recognized the antics"
of the the famed prankster puppet made flesh.
And I've got a payback gig
with an exploding volcano finale that you're messing up!
So why do I see no lava? Ha ha!
(Mumbling)
(Gasp)
I'm still 3 pounds of wood short of a gusher!
"Then for your lousy spellmaking,"
you shall return to wood.
Everybody's a critic!
"Come on, buddy. Say something, pal."
Anything.
"Get your hand out of my shirt, Mac."
"And now, the shapeshifter power."
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
All: Whoa!
(Groaning)
Uhh!
The puppet.
3 pounds of wood!
Jackie: Giddy-up!
Whoa!
Uncle: Hot-cha!
Cha is not so hot.
Ptaah!
Cherry gelatin?
"It's not banana flavored, but I think it'll do."
"Well, grab some to go."
We have to get him back to section 13.
Jackie: It looks like the last laugh is on the monkey king.
"Hey, Jackie. Yes?"
Was it hard to learn English?
"Yes! Very, very difficult."
"I learned from TV, news, and documentaries."
"Word by word, just like a puzzle."
"Now I--I know perfect cantonese, of course, my mother's language,"
"mandarin, Chinese, shandonese,"
"ok English, Korean, Japanese."
"You have to know more, not just one language."
Not enough. You have to learn second language.
You're proud of yourself.
"Remember, learn more language."
"Tch, if we go any deeper into Mexico, we'll hit China."
"Jade, on the phone."
"Uncle, we have been hiking for hours"
and there is still no sign.
Are you certain this cat's whisker will work?
You do not trust uncle's locator spell ingredients?
What finds rats? A cat!
One more thing. Daolon wong
will stop at nothing to gain
the talisman power within the rat.
"So, do not dilly-dally."
But I am not dilly-dallying.
Oh. Must go. Lunch is ready.
Whoa. Acupuncture city. (Laughs)
"Real acupuncture is a good thing, Jade."
"It stimulates the energy channels,"
and rids the body of--
"<i>hola, seor chan.</i>"
Bad chi.
"Fork over your rat finder, chan."
"Come and get it, superfreaks."
"Uh, no, uh, go and find your own."
"Jade, get help."
Ohh.
Wah!
Agh!
Wah!
Aah!
Unh.
Whoa!
Too bad your niece won't be showing up
with the <i> federales</i> anytime soon.
"Help has arrived, amigo."
All: El toro!
Grr.
(Grunts)
Sorry... Uhh!
Whoa! Oof.
(Yelling)
Whoa!
"We'll be back, chan!"
Antler action!
It is fortunate that Jade located me and paco.
"Yes, El toro-- ugh--quite."
"So, did you manage to scout any likely rat habitats?"
"Just the village of nueva plata,"
though there is rumored to be
an abandoned silver mine nearby.
Is not! Is too!
Is not! Is too!
"Hey, children."
Why do you argue?
Paco just can't accept the fact that supermoose
"is, like, so totally last year."
Is not! À <i> El cuernudo</i> à <i> poderoso</i>
is the greatest masked hero ever.
The greatest?
"Uh, that is a lovely moose pen, paco,"
but I think we can all agree
that finding the rat
"before the dark forces return,"
is the most important thing right now.
So totally 90s.
So totally not.
Do you hear that?
You did not mention there would be more than one rat.
Not that I am bothered.
Which is the rat that we want?
The one with the power
"to bring motion to the motionless, moose boy."
This way!
Jackie: It is...
Silver.
Excavated from the mine to build this shrine.
In honor of quetzalcoatl.
Ko-wetzel-who-zel?
"The Mayan god of the sun, sky and agriculture."
"According to legend, he was part human and part plumed serpent."
"Well, if he's not part rat,"
where is the little-- (Rat squeaks)
Aah!
Bingo.
Nngh-aah!
"Cute little varmint, isn't he?"
(Kisses)
(Choking) Ew! Yech.
Did it hurt you?
"Uh, no. It, uh, merely took me by surprise, paco."
I will catch him.
Brr-argh!
"No! If you startle the rat, you could activate its--"
power.
Sorry.
Who dares trespass in my lair?
The talisman power?
Motion to the motionless.
Well?
"Uh, we are not trespassers,"
"your lordship, sir. Uh, we are, uh--"
(rat squeaking)
Gotcha!
"Uh, pest control."
"Uh, yes, uh, a deity such as yourself"
can not have rats in his lair. Most unbecoming.
Cihuacoatl.
"It looks more like a Mickey,"
but you can name him whatever you want.
"That creature's name is of no concern to me, Princess."
Quetzalcoatl thinks Jade...
Is the Mayan goddess of the earth!
Uh...
"I sort of see a resemblance, but come on."
My do's way sassier than hers.
"I see you have not lost your sense of humor, cihuacoatl."
Come. Let us at last complete our journey.
"Uh, what journey?"
We must fly together into the sun.
Heh heh.
Heh heh.
I don't suppose you'd believe
"you're really just a statue, would you?"
"Let us fly into the sun,"
so that our combined magic
will rain upon the earth
and protect the land from the forces of darkness.
The statue can do that?
I do not want to wait and find out.
You will not have to.
"Princess, the sun awaits."
Heh. You got it. Let me just run out
for some tanning butter. Ooh.
Who dares?
Xolotl.
You are talking to me?
Oh. Quetzalcoatl thinks El toro
is the god of the underworld!
You Bear the horned feet.
You are xolotl's messenger.
But they are antlers.
El toro: Wait!
He is not-- I am not--
ohh!
You will not take cihuacoatl to the underworld
while I am here to defend her.
Aah!
Oof!
(Groans)
"El toro, are you ok?"
"Of course, paco."
The statue can shoot fire from his hands?
"God of the sun, duh."
"Chan had a masked crime fighter with him, your wongship."
The sun was in our eyes!
We need bigger weapons!
"Excuses, excuses! I see that if I wish"
"this task accomplished, I must do it myself."
Oof! Ooh.
"That's cool. We'll wait here,"
"rest up, order some chi pizza."
Humph. You 3 shall accompany me and watch!
Perhaps you will learn something.
"Uh, perhaps quetzalcoatl would not be so angry"
"if you prove to him you are not, you know..."
El toro fuerte never removes his mask.
"Unhand the Princess, or face my wrath."
"Uh, maybe you should make an exception."
"Go, go, go!"
"The statue can fly, too?"
"God of the sky, duh."
Jackie: In here.
Quetzalcoatl: Aargh!
"Jade: Hi-yo, silver mine."
In you go!
Hang on tight!
(Grunting)
Please keep your paws and whiskers
inside the vehicle at all times.
(Rumbling)
(Grunting)
The underworld? No!
Bad day. <i>Muy</i> bad.
Aah!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello? Uncle? Now is not a good time.
What is more important than talking to uncle?
"Jackie: I am in a speeding mining car,"
"fleeing a reanimated Mayan statue,"
trying to seize Jade so he can fly her into the sun!
Why did you not say so?
It seems you have found the rat.
Yes.
"If the living statue touches the rat again,"
he will return to his original form.
I do not think he is in the mood to do us any favors.
Unh!
Uncle: One more thing...
(Scream)
Whoa! Oof.
(Groans)
Whee. Can we ride again?
"Flee no more, xolotl."
The statue can grow unbreakable vines?
"I know, agriculture, duh."
"Where are your dark powers now, xolotl?"
Hello...
"Wake up and smell the chimichangas, wingding."
"""A,"" he's not--uh, whoever you think he is."
"2, you're really a statue."
"And ""b,"" I may have an incredibly cool coif,"
but I'm not a Mayan goddess.
Hmm. Clearly xolotl has clouded your mind
with his dark magic.
"Grr... I mean, yes."
"And now that you've imprisoned him,"
"the fog has lifted, oh, mighty lizard-head-guy."
Now do your favorite goddess a favor
and pet the pretty rat.
"An odd request, but as you wish."
Daolon wong: Ahh!
I see my work has already been done for me.
I will take the rat.
"The rat is mine. And, like the rat,"
my enemies have been caged.
Apparently by this able-bodied warrior.
"Yeah, right, uh, maybe giant lizard guy"
has better powers than us.
Ever think of that?
Yeah. Excuses!
Who are the interlopers?
They're evil to the Max.
don't let them rip off the rat.
"Uh, I mean, it would please your most trusty goddess"
"to not let the true villains escape, o great flying one."
But it is he who bears the symbol of the horned one.
"Paco, give me your pen."
Huh?
Let us depart.
Oomph! (Squeaking)
Oh! What?
"Be gone, brat!"
Oh!
You just stand there?
"Hey, watch and learn, remember?"
"Look, oh lord of sunlight,"
he is truly the god of the underworld.
"You, there!"
Your power of light is no match for the blackest chi.
Dark magic.
"So, you are truly xolotl."
"But then, you..."
Uh...
Talk later!
Princess!
See? The first lesson of battle: Surprise the enemy.
Surprise!
What? Stop her!
Little girl? We can handle that.
(Panting)
(Pants)
Hey! Oh!
Gah!
Adios.
Ooh. Where's a mouse hole when you need one?
Give me that!
Hi. We're your new neighbors.
Can we borrow a cup of rat?
"<i>Eh, cuernudo?</i>"
How about a heaping helping of moose?
(Squeaks)
"Come here, you!"
(Gulps)
<i>Ay-yi-yi!</i>
What is keeping those fools?
(Henchmen screaming)
Supermooses: Antler action!
<i>Que?</i>
<i>Viva los cuernudos</i> à <i> poderosos!</i>
More horned ones?
Uh-uh. Antlers.
"Hey, uh, supermooses... Supermeese?"
"You guys, free my friends!"
¶ Ba-da-ba-ba ba-ba ¶
antler...
Action!
Ooh.
"Freedom is mine, once again!"
Antler action!
Shoo!
Shoo!
Shoo!
"Stop, xolotl!"
I shall right my wrongs.
You shall try.
Ooh!
"Well, I'll be stuffed. Candy!"
Sweet!
"Open season, boys!"
It's like a birthday party!
Super moose to the rescue!
(Gasps)
<i>Los cuernudos</i> àneed help!
Oomph! Ugh.
Finn: Piatas. Made to take a beating.
Tag. Quit it. Ow.
Whoa!
Ahem!
Ok. It's on.
No. It is over.
Supermoose: ¶ boo-doo-dul-oo-boo boo-boo ¶
yeah! Bravo!
Whoa! Oof!
Give me the rat!
"Why, I will scatter its power back to the winds!"
I don't care if he isn't cute.
I won't let you hurt him!
"Very well, child."
Quetzalcoatl: And I do not care
if she is not a goddess.
I will not let you harm her!
Yeeow!
Ho-ho! You go!
You da sun god! You da sun god!
"Give me some hoof there, partner!"
Such power within this small creature.
And such courage within you.
With heroes such as you
"protecting the land from the forces of darkness,"
I am content to return to my proper place.
Quetzalcoatl bids you farewell.
I think quetzalcoatl is <i> muy excelente.</i>
"Almost as <i> excelente</i> as you, El toro."
You saved us all.
Him and <i> El</i> - à <i> cuernudo poderoso.</i>
Some toys never go out of style.
(Rat squeaks)
"Jade, I think it is feeding time."
Want to do the honors?
"Uh, <i> si.</i>"
"Jade: I think it likes you, seor fuerte!"
Cute!
"Hey, Jackie! Yes?"
Have you done any extreme sports?
"When I'm filming everyday, I always do"
"the dangerous things, the dangerous things."
"Then when I get hurt, you can see it on the screen."
"Some of my friends,"
they went skiing.
"Coming back, one broken leg,"
one broken arm.
"When on holiday, I never do these kinds of things."
"On the screening, I do everything."
Are we there yet?
"Patience, Jade."
We will not know where there is
until uncle's locator spell
leads us to the animal we seek.
The tiger who has inherited the talisman power
of yin and Yang.
"Well, make it hurry,"
'cause it reeks something fierce in here.
"Are you sure the spell is accurate, uncle?"
Nevada is not exactly known as tiger country.
Never mock the sock.
It's our only chance of finding the tiger
before the forces of darkness do.
"Well, bet ya daolon wong doesn't have to"
spend all day cooped up in a smelly car.
(Chants)
Pee-yew! Are we there yet?
"So, big d, - we really appreciate"
you turning us into superpowered dark chi dudes
"and all, but we gotta talk image."
"I'm not digging the whole orange vibe,"
and these outfits kinda scream boy band.
"Nah, we look like kiss."
We look like circus freaks.
Hey! Can you not all see
that I am trying to concentrate?
I must find the tiger and acquire its power
before that accursed old man and his family intrude.
What?
Aah! Daolon wong!
Aah!
(Gurgles) Ow!
(Gurgles) Ow!
(Chants)
(Chants)
Whoa!
Get out there and stop them! But--
now!
"Jackie, look out!"
Aah!
All: Aah!
"Dudes, we have powers."
"Oh, yeah."
Sweet!
(All laugh)
Do you think they are... All right? Ow!
Of course they are all right!
They are magic! Now drive! Quickly!
(Growls)
Uncle: Stop the car!
The tiger we seek is here!
Jackie: In las Vegas?
I think the world famous Sasha makes the cut.
"But uncle, even if it is the right tiger,"
what am I supposed to say?
"""Hello, my name is Jackie."
"Can I borrow your star attraction?"""
Ow!
You figure it out!
Uncle must do research.
"When daolon wong arrives,"
we will need powerful spells to combat him.
Shoo! Shoo!
"Come on, Jackie. We'll take care of the tiger,"
and then take in Vegas.
"Some shows, some all-you-can-eat buffets..."
"Jade, what part of daolon wong did you not understand?"
Oh!
"Sasha has the heart of a savage predator,"
but we have tamed her wild nature
"with years of training. Right, ulf?"
"Ya, Helmut!"
Now Sasha is our Princess!
Room service?
"Yes, please send up one vial of eel saliva,"
"3 jars of powdered duck feet,"
and a pair of moose antlers.
What?
What kind of hotel does not have eel saliva?
"Hey, uncle, I know you're busy,"
"so if you want me to go help Jackie,"
just signal by yelling into the phone.
I do not want chicken fingers!
I require duck feet!
You got it!
"So, you want to borrow our Sasha?"
"Uh, yes. Um, I'll pay you?"
(Both laugh)
Ulf giggles at you!
And Helmut chortles!
"Wait, you do not understand!"
Your tiger is in danger!
"Is that a threat, mister?"
"What? No, not danger from me!"
"From who, then?"
"Um, a dark chi wizard?"
"Please, let me explain--"
(impersonating Elvis) Thank you very much.
"Yo, red, how ya doin'?"
"Thank you, thank you very much."
...peanut butter sandwich.
"Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much."
Get me a banana and peanut butter sandwich?
"Uh, yes, thank you very much."
"Now, where would I keep a--"
aah!
(Gasps)
"Uh, nice tiger."
Whew! Tame tiger.
"Hello, uh, Sasha."
Would you like to go for a walk?
Come with Jackie. Come on.
(Meows) Please?
If the yin Yang power means balance...
Good balance.
Good Sasha. Huh?
Bad Sasha!
(Gasps)
Jackie!
2 Sashas?
Just one! And her nice half is getting away!
"¶ Oh, pretty tiger ¶"
"Sasha is excited, ya?"
She loves to train with Helmut and ulf.
(Both scream)
(Meows)
(Helmut and ulf screaming)
Jackie.
(Both scream)
Huh?
Sasha is very moody today.
"You have the keys, ya?"
Bad day. Bad day. Bad day. Bad day.
"Jackie, you rock!"
"You can pull 'em back together, right?"
"Uh-oh. Jackie's coming apart, too!"
"Jackie, are you ok?!"
"Oh, yeah."
Thank you for asking.
Aah!
What? What?
Aah! Aah!
"Hey, I have a zit."
Get off of my body or I'll pop you!
"Oof! I do not wish to argue,"
"but this is my body, too!"
"I didn't let the yin-Yang power finish separating you,"
"so one head's your dark side, and the other is..."
Light! That's me!
There's only one sure way to put your heads back together.
"Come on, we really have to find those tigers!"
There goes one!
Uh-oh.
And I thought we looked freaky.
Forget them! The animal is near!
Come on!
Bring it on!
I'll whup ya with one hand.
Hey!
Hmm?
Hmm?
Yes.
What are you looking at?
I do not see the tiger!
Maybe we should split up.
So I got all the brains.
Tiger at 12 o'clock.
Aah! It's a tiger!
A tiger! Aah!
"Uh, heads up, guys."
"And now, to absorb your glorious power."
(Chants)
Hmm?
The extraction spell is not working!
"Yo, dao-man, you online?"
We eyeballed the cat!
Nonsense! The animal is here before me.
Who knew there were so many tigers in Vegas?
"You sure about that, boss?"
This one's white.
And it's mean.
Mean?
(Gasps) I possess only the yin of the beast.
Bring me the Yang immediately!
Gotcha!
"Hello, kitty."
Muzzle!
(Growls)
(Growls)
We did it!
We are kings of the jungle!
"Hand over the tomcat, chan,"
or we'll wipe that smile off your faces.
Let's rock!
Wait! - We cannot leave the tiger with--
whoa!
Get the cat!
Sorry!
"Oh, sorry!"
"Oh, did I hurt you?"
All: Aah! Tiger! Aah! Tiger!
"No, wrong way!"
Whoa!
"3 jokers, and jackies are wild."
Who's in?
Not me!
"Hey, you kicked them with my leg!"
Missed me!
Stop! Please!
Can we talk about this?
Come on!
Hold this.
Aah!
"Heads, you lose!"
Ow!
Double or nothing.
"Oh, no."
Jackpot.
Twofer!
"Hello, muzzle?"
This is the all-you-can't-eat buffet.
(Groans)
We're on a winning streak. 2 tigers to none!
You have the other tiger?
"Yo, d-man, beam us up."
Jackie! Jackie!
The bad guys have both Sashas!
"If the anti-uncle drains their power,"
you guys'll be stuck this way!
(Gasps) Forever?
"Oh, boy."
(Telephone rings)
Room service? I have been waiting for--
"uncle, thank goodness you are--"
Jackie! How can you leave uncle
at a shabby hotel with no eel saliva?
Pull your tongue out of your mouth and wring out the spit.
(Gasps) You call uncle an eel?!
"Uncle, I'm sorry. No, I'm not!"
"Yes, I am. No, I'm not."
"Jackie, why do you babble like a crazy person?"
Both: Because I have 2 heads.
And daolon wong has 2 tigers.
We need your locator spell.
"(Sighs) It's still not long enough, ulf."
"Oh, we must find a way out, Helmut."
It is nearly showtime.
"At last, I shall absorb the power of--"
(sniffs) Hmm?
Wasn't me.
Hello!
"Hurry, fathead!"
"Hey, our heads are the same size!"
Off with his heads!
All: Whoa!
"Well, that's the opposite of what we had in mind."
Ah! Free at last!
Attack!
(Growls)
Fighting is not nice.
"You cannot defeat me, old man."
"Who are you calling old, you bag of bones!?"
Aah!
You have learned the yen huo fire magic?
Substituting eel saliva with mayonnaise.
No match for the genuine article!
"Nice teamwork, partner."
don't touch me.
Aah!
(Gasps)
"Uh, hello."
(Audience oohs and aahs)
Thank you. Aah!
Wonder what this one does?
Whoa!
Aah!
don't touch me.
No problem.
Ow!
(Audience cheers)
"So, which one's Helmut and which one's ulf?"
Your half-baked spells cannot defeat me!
I blame room service!
Uh-oh.
"Come to me, talisman magic!"
(Chanting)
Jackie!
Giddyap!
Abra-cadabra?
Eh?
"No, I don't wanna go back!"
"Come on, we belong together!"
(Audience cheers)
"The one, the only!"
Now we just have to convince
Helmut and ulf to let us--
"take the nasty tiger, please!"
Ya! We will be auditioning for a juggling Bear.
"Well, no bears in the Chinese zodiac, right?"
"Hey Jackie, do you play video games?"
I really love all kinds of video.
"Ok, I play Tetris."
"People come to talk to me, I just keep playing."
One day I dream my head no fit into any hole.
"I get up, I take my video game away."
It's bad.
(Rooster crowing)
Do not look down. Do not look down.
Do not look down. Do not look--
guhh!
"Please step inside this nice, cozy magic cage"
so that you do not...
Levitate!
Wait! Dark forces wish to steal your magic!
I'm only trying to protect you!
Guess the chicken can fly.
"Question is, chan, can you?"
Aah!
Aah!
Can we do that?
Never know till you try.
Whoa!
Now let's go home to--
aah!
I did it!
"Uh, way to go?"
"Give up the bird, chan."
Locked! Whoa!
Try knocking. Maybe somebody'll--
all: Aah!
Jackie?
Ohh. Jade!
You are supposed to be on the--
observation deck.
How did you think I observed you getting creamed?
(Cell phone rings)
Jackie!
Uncle?
Have you found the rooster?
"Yes, I just--"
"good, because a new spell"
has revealed the location
of the next magic animal that we seek.
You must meet us where the pig will be found.
Tohru is preparing a magic cage
which will prevent it from activating
it's power of heat beam eyes.
(Sighs) I will change our flight.
Another mission? Where we going this time?
Paris? Moscow? Tahiti?
"Arline, Kansas."
Yee-haw.
"Hey, Jackie, I think egbert wants to stretch his legs."
We cannot let him out of the cage
until he is safely inside section 13.
"So, where's uncle?"
"Tohru: I do not think this is the interstate, sensei."
Of course it is interstate! Map does not lie!
We came all the way from Malaysia.
How did we arrive first?
"Well, uncle may not be here, but the pig is."
"Jade, how are we supposed to find it"
without uncle's locator spell?
"""Local beaut mordecai claimed first prize"
"at last week's county fair."""
Let's give a little hey-howdy-do to our noble oinker.
"Remember, do not mention magic."
No one ever believes.
"Now, what's a city feller like you"
want with a 280-pound Hampshire boar?
"Uh, good question, farmer MacDonald."
"Um, well, I am an archaeologist, and--"
you mean like a eye doctor?
"Uh, no, that is an optometrist."
Archaeologists study very old things.
Old? Mordecai ain't turned 3 yet!
Uh...
"Let's cut to the chase, mister."
"Whatever pigs cost, we'll pay double."
"Naw, I could never part with mordecai."
"He done so good at county,"
I figure he might just fetch a ribbon at the state fair.
"'Sides, I know city slicker hogwash when I smells it."
"Well, what are we gonna do now, Mr. archaeologist?"
You are going back to the motel.
Ohh!
Mordecai?
Mordecai?
Rise and shine.
Now come with farmer Jackie.
A dark chi wizard is coming to--
whup!
I don't think this little piggy's going to market.
"Jade, you are supposed to be guarding the--"
egbert wanted to hang with the other white meat.
"Ok, pig."
No more horsing around.
Uh-oh--baah!
"Shh! No, it's not-- (Crows)"
"Ah, sunrise."
Time to milk the...
What in tarnation?!
It's the middle of the night.
MacDonald: You.
"Ok, we'll pay you triple,"
but that's our final offer.
Buford! E.B.!
We've got ourselves a couple of rustlers.
"No, we do not want to rustle."
Yaaah!
Daaah!
"They's been stealin' chickens, too!"
"Unh! Please, can't we just talk about--ooh!"
Maybe they don't know how to talk.
"My brother e.B. Here graduated Stanford, phi beta kappi!"
And buford here is a renowned nuclear physicist.
Whoa! Gah!
Uhh! Guh!
<i>Dr.</i> buford MacDonald?
Your books are very insightful.
Thank you.
Ohh! Uhh!
Where is uncle?
(Tohru sighs)
Perhaps we should stop and ask directions.
Uncle knows how to read map!
Oh. Ow!
Map must be right side up.
Rrr.
(Splutters)
You're wastin' milk!
"Oh, man!"
Now you're wastin' eggs!
All part of a balanced breakfast!
Whoa!
(Jade gasps)
"Uh, Jackie..."
Talk later. Wah!
"Ain't nobody takin' my pig, Mr. archeologist."
(Crows)
"We caught 'em, pa."
Soowee!
(Gasps)
Mordecai!
The pig is gone!
"F.Y.I., so's the rooster."
But how?
Maybe now you'll tell me where my pig's up and gone to.
"I do not know,"
but some very bad men may have taken him.
"So, y'all was just decoys, huh?"
"C'mon, boys. Let's go nab us their pig-rustlin' compadres!"
"Uh, no! That is not what I meant!"
You think daolon wong bagged our barnyard buddies?
"If he didn't, the animals are vulnerable to him."
Whoa!
I'm sorry! I owe you a scarecrow!
They're gettin' away!
After 'em! After them!
(Jackie panting)
(Clatter)
"Uh...Uh, shoo?"
Or n-not.
(Sighs) I think we lost 'em.
Now we just have to--
pork ahoy!
(Squeals and snorts)
"Ok, feeding time is over."
Who wants to come with Jackie?
Aah!
Where is uncle?!
"Quickly, tohru!"
The forces of darkness wait for no man!
(Sighs)
"Willy-John, I will marry you when pigs fly!"
Jackie: Waaaah!
"Over here, Jackie!"
Hyuh! Unh!
Yippee-Kai-ya-aa-aa!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Jade!
"Easy, boy. That's it. Easy."
"Come on, egbert. Take us down."
Whoa!
Uhh! Ohh...
MacDonald: Soowee! Mordecai!
Soowee!
"I done missed you, too, little feller."
"Come on, egbert."
Who's your pal?
I thought <i> gallus domesticus</i> àwas a flightless bird.
And I think a flyin' chicken
wins blue ribbon at the state fair.
(Men clucking)
Them city folks can't even cluck a decent rooster call.
Come on! They have egbert and mordecai!
Where is uncle?!
Uncle: Jackie!
Where is rooster?!
"don't mind this here tether, pretty bird."
It's just so's you don't go flyin' off nowhere.
Daolon: The pig <i>and</i> the rooster.
Heh. How kind of you to gather them for me.
For you? Why come all you city fellers
is suddenly after my livestock?
"Show 'im the road, boys."
<i>Gan! Ren! Chui!</i>
(Gasps) Ooh!
"What city you fellers from, anyhow?"
"Creatures, surrender your powers"
to daolon wong!
Hey!
Hey!
(Daolon chanting)
Ohh!
Chan.
Tohru!
Hiya!
Daolon: Gan...Ren...Off!
What in Sam hill's nanny is goin' on here?
"The animals have magic powers,"
and dark forces have come to claim them.
Magic?
"Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?"
Ahh. Exterminate the mortals
and bring the beasts to me!
"Uh, soowee!"
"You get your magic butt off of my property, mister."
Magic must defeat magic butt.
(Chanting)
Get him!
"Jackie, get those swine!"
(Snorts)
Heh. Sorry.
Aiyaa!
Hoowee!
They're defyin' the known laws of physics!
With our house!
"Jackie, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore."
"Jade, bring the pig this--whaah!"
(Panting)
The house is flying.
Hello? Did you not catch my <i> wizard of oz</i> reference?
There's no place like home...
To kick your butt!
"Ok, mordecai, heat beam the bad guys!"
Please?
(Hiss)
Uhh!
"That'll do, pig."
That'll do.
It's a twister!
(All scream)
Auntie em! Auntie em!
Tornadie!
MacDonald: They're headin' northeast!
"Hang a right up at route 41, and we'll--"
"go straight, tohru!"
Route 41 is not on my map!
I don't care if it's on your map
or buford's underpants.
"Ah, pa."
Turn right!
- Straight. - Right! - Straight!
- Right! - Straight!
Right!
You want a piece of uncle?
"Ready to buy the farm, chan?"
(Chow groans)
"We got your back, Jackie."
"Ah, but who has yours?"
The power of levitation shall be mi--
(Jackie groans)
"Duck, Jackie!"
Wah!
My bad.
Grr!
Aah!
Whoa. I made it.
(Clucks)
Talkin' Turkey.
(Chanting)
Egbert!
Mordecai!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
"Let us go, you power hog!"
"No! But with the power of the hog,"
I shall reduce you both to ashes.
Gah!
Your feeble cage cannot withstand
the burning gaze of my...
Uh...Heat-beam eyes?
"My cage is forged of good chi, feeble one!"
I will incinerate you... Next time.
Jade: Whoa.
MacDonald: Y'all sure about this?
Absolutely.
After trying to rustle your pig...
And relocating your house to another county...
The least I can do is reward you
with a former flying chicken.
"'Sides, pa,"
they's demonstratin' a psychological bond.
Yep. They's buddies.
Uncle: Jackie! Time to go!
"- Hey, Jackie. - Yes?"
What do you do with your free time?
My free time. I don't really have a lot of free time.
I'd rather stay in the office.
I call up all the script writer.
I watch a lot of DVD...
"Training, and meeting..."
Editing.
Do I have a free time?
Now I see why they call this place bizarre.
"Jade, it is a bazaar."
Anywhere grown men play with baby toys is bizarre in my book.
Uncle is not playing.
"This rattle's filled with the enchanted teeth of mongoose,"
"which will lead us to the snake,"
which possesses the power of invisibility.
"Do you think our search will take long, sensei?"
(Rattling) Oh! No. I do not.
(Rattling)
The snake we seek must be within.
"Jackie, take basket!"
Oh!
Do not even breathe.
Cobras are very poisonous.
I know.
They say you can hypnotize 'em
by looking right into their eyes.
Jade!
(Rattling)
Ugg! Uncle!
But not our snake. Put basket down.
Ugg. How?
"Quickly, of course."
We must find real snake before dark forces arrive.
Ahh!
Aah!
Huh?
(Hiss)
Ow.
You!
Billy goat!
"Uh, mommy!"
Whoa! Mrs. t?
What brings you to bizarr-o world?
And when are you leaving?
"Mother, what a coincidence"
bumping into you all the way in India.
Coincidence?
You invited me!
Uh-oh.
Tohru!
You did not tell uncle you invited spider woman!
(Moans)
See? Even Jackie moans with displeasure at her arrival.
"Uh, Jackie?"
Are you all right?
"Jackie, how many fingers do you see?"
(Groaning)
(Gasps) Jackie has been bitten by snake.
"Well, what a co-inky-dink. We're looking for a snake."
"These strange men, they appeared out of thin air."
They used to be men. Now they're card-carrying members
of the forces of darkness.
"Stop them, tohru!"
Yarrgg--ulp.
My baby will not fight forces of darkness!
(Laughs) Hear that?
Yeah. Tohru's mommy won't let him come out and play.
Heh heh. Maybe he needs his diaper changed.
(All laugh)
Hohhh!
"Stop them, Jackie!"
"Eh, hello."
Jackie!
Heh heh. That's called the slippery cobra technique.
Whoa.
I'm not sure who's dizzier.
Chan or me?
Maybe we should get Jackie to a doctor.
"We must find snake before dark forces do,"
then uncle will cure Jackie.
Do not worry. I once saw television program about cobra poisoning.
Jackie only in stage one.
Very slight dryness of mouth.
(Wheezes)
(Jackie wheezing)
Wa...Ter...
Must have...Water.
Wa...Ter.
Thank you.
Yarrr...Matey!
Stage 2?
Stark-raving madness.
Shiver me timbers! Yo ho ho!
(Humming popeye theme)
Luckily stage 2 very brief.
Do not understand.
Locator spell was warm near first basket.
Now it is cold.
(Rattle)
(Gasps)
The magic snake!
"Oh, look! It is getting away!"
And so are we!
See ya.
"Uncle, if daolon wong gets the snake,"
he'll have the power of--
shh!
The talisman power of invisibility
lies within the snake within the egg.
(Rattling)
"Uncle, you so sly."
Do not tell your mother.
"She has big mouth, and dark forces must not discover the truth."
It is best if we treat Jackie before onset of stage 3.
What happens in stage 3?
(Moans)
Jackie lies motionless on ground.
Jackie needs root of Willow tree.
"Yes, Willow tree perfect, if Jackie had chapped lips."
Then what does madam tarantula recommend?
Sycamore sap.
Jackie does not have athlete's foot.
Must use garlic.
Too much garlic!
No such thing too much garlic.
Uncle knew you were vampire.
Grrr. Junk seller!
"Oh, blood sucker!"
Jade: Hey... It's working!
Hello.
Good thing I was here to help.
What kind of uncle are you?
I would never let my tohru play with snakes.
"Mother, please."
There is no need to be so overprotective.
Overprotective?
Mother is not overprotective!
You must eat. It is past lunchtime.
"Yes, mother."
I am feeling much better. Thank you.
"Of course you are, thanks to my remedies."
Mine!
"No, mine! No, mine!"
"No, mine. Mine!"
Mine! Mine!
Ah! You yell too much.
Gives me headache. I am going to bed.
You are old yeller. And that is uncle's room.
Billy goat's suitcase on my bed?
He has no respect for other people's things.
(Sniffs)
"Garlic, fahh!"
"Bad for snake bite, but good for headache."
Ahh...
Essence of snake eggshell even better.
Mmm...
"Ahh, headache disappearing."
"Ah, head feeling much-- (Gasps)"
Where is my head?
Ohh!
Some kind of magic.
A trick!
Billy goat did this to me!
He will pay!
"Mother means well,"
but sometimes I think she forgets that I am a grown man.
"Uh, very grown."
"When she gets in your face, tell her to give you some space."
She would just take it the wrong way.
(Sighs)
"I love her, but sometimes..."
I wish mother would just disappear.
"Oh, be careful what you wish for, tohru."
"Mother, I made warm milk for you."
Mommy?
"Aw, why can't we go help tohru look for his mom?"
"Because uncle must guard egg from forces of darkness while Jackie recuperates,"
and because uncle must beat Jade in a friendly game of mah-jongg.
Well?
The concierge said mother
scheduled a bus tour to the Taj Mahal.
Told you the dark chi dudes didn't get her.
Of course they did not.
She is more fearsome than they.
Grrr.
Whoa-aah!
"Sensei, are you all right?"
(Giggles)
Chair very slippery.
"Now, it is your move, Jade."
Whoa! I win!
"Uh-huh, uh-huh! It's my birthday!"
I won! You lost!
Impossible!
I know three dark warriors
who are finally about to make daolon wong a happy wizard.
Let's not be hasty.
This snake can make us invisible.
We can sneak into any movie we want for free.
"Ahem. If ol' crazy eyes can't see us,"
we can sneak up and stomp the chi outta him.
And force him to turn us back
into our normal old selves.
Yeah!
Talisman power...Ho!
"Hey, I can still see you guys."
"Uh, 'cause we're all invisible."
Ohh!
I was never any good at science.
"Hiya, boss."
Ratso here was wondering
"if you needed any pictures hung, big d."
All that I need is for you to bring me the correct snake!
(Screaming)
"Are you certain you won't return home with us, tohru?"
I should wait here for mother to return from her tour.
Good thing we are leaving.
Hotel has terrible draft.
Whoa!
Hotel gives uncle the willies.
It is as if spirits lurk.
(Knock at door) Bellhop!
Ahh! Jackie!
Bellhops are very careless.
You must not let them carry bag containing snake egg.
Uggh!
Is that a fact?
"Hey, it's a trick."
Snakes don't lay eggs.
Yeah!
"Ok, you got me."
Wait. Do they?
Get chan!
"So, the egg is magic."
Finn: Chan!
Jackie!
Egg very fragile!
"If it breaks, talisman power could be released."
Or a baby snake could get hurt.
Jackie needs backup. Oop!
Too dangerous!
Aww...
"Tohru, help Jackie."
"I cannot climb up there, sensei."
Good. Too dangerous.
"The egg, chan, or we scramble you."
I prefer over easy.
Egg roll!
Huh?
Whoa... Whoa...
Invisible snake or flying one?
Ohh!
Why did egg not break?
Mrs. t: Because chicken eggs are fragile.
Snake eggs are durable.
Mommy?
Oh. Hello.
Someone's here.
Whoaaaa! Whoaaaa!
"Unlike egg, forces of darkness do not bounce."
"Tohru, catch your mother!"
I...Had better go fetch the egg.
I'll go with.
"Do not worry, mother."
Sensei will find a way to make you visible again.
Why? She is more pleasing to the eyes this way.
"This is my choice, tohru."
I will remain invisible
so that I may always protect my baby.
(Gulp) Always?
Tell me you have my snake.
"Uh... Right here, big d."
And I cannot see it? Why?
'Cause it's invisible.
Look! There it goes!
Whoa! It's climbing up my pants.
Whoa-oaa-oaa!
So be it.
Whoa.
There!
Paper beats rock!
Mine!
Whoop.
Ooh ooh! Ow ow! Aii aii!
Whoa!
Chow: Mine!
Hey...
The egg's a dud.
Not dud. Snake invisible.
Duh.
Poor little guy's scared.
He activated the talisman power for protection.
End of the trail.
For you!
"I told you, no fighting forces of darkness."
Not even the skinny one?
Ha ha ha!
"That's right, tohru. Listen to mommy."
Gohh! Gaa! Unh!
Had enough of mommy?
Heh. Come and get me.
Mother!
"Remain in safety zone, tohru."
"Ha ha ha. Where am I, over here?"
Or am I over here?
Mommy!
(Gasps)
Grrr....
Nobody touches my mommy.
Heh heh.
Aah!
Uhh.
"Sometimes I can take care of myself, mother."
And you.
My baby.
"Any last wishes, chan?"
Uhh! Oof!
"Jade, what are you doing?"
Shh!
Told you they can be hypnotized.
"Now, let's get you back to section 13 with the other animals,"
for your safety.
Sensei says this is the only way to make you visible again.
Hmph. Probably poison.
Or garlic. (Grumbles)
(Gasps)
What? What is it?
Do not look in mirror.
Aaaah!
Billy goat!
You will pay for this!
Aiiya!
"Tohru: Mommy, no!"
See? Your fault.
Told you antidote should always contain garlic.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, did you do well in school?"
Kind of. I'm very bad boy.
I don't want to get up in the morning.
Later on. Later on.
"The teacher been training me,"
become very disciplined.
"Get up 5:00 in the morning, training, training, training."
Work very hard every day.
"But usually, I'm pretty good."
Jackie: Traveling through Scotland
is like walking in pea soup.
How can you think of food
when the forces of darkness are near?
I meant it is difficult
"to see in this fog, uncle."
Fog not important!
Locator spell is.
The enchanted moth is drawn
to enchanted wool.
Its light leads us through the fog
toward the power of the sheep.
Ha ha ha! But we are heading
toward the lake.
I do not think that the loch ness monster
is one of the animals of the Chinese zodiac.
(Gasps)
What is that?
Loch ness monster!
(Gasps)
Jackie: Jade?
"Hey, Jackie. Uncle."
You are supposed
"to be at the bed and breakfast,"
"where there is no daolon wong,"
no dark chi warriors--
no cable.
Jade: Whoa.
Whole lotta lamb.
We must seek the most noble
of the beasts.
"Baa, baa, black sheep,"
have you any magic?
Eh...Next.
"One down, 199 to go."
"Jade: don't start countin' sheep yet, Jackie,"
'cause I see one woolly bully.
We found it?
Tsk! We?
Quiet!
Startling the beast may activate its power
of astral projection.
"Finn: Evenin', chan."
I'll have the roast lamb.
(Gasps) Dark chi warriors!
Wow.
Dude fainted.
The sheep released its astral form!
Hyah!
Hee-yah!
Ohh! (Laughs)
You've been fleeced!
Uncle: Jade...
Uncle must borrow this.
"Uh, you're welcome?"
Uncle needs this.
My belt?
Ohh!
Ohh. Like a--uhh!--
baby elephant! Ohh.
"(Gasps) Oh, no!"
The loch ness monster!
Where?! Where?!
Phthht!
Made ya look!
She--uhh!
Whoa. Ohh--uhh!
"Ohh, ohh!"
Time-out.
"Yo, yo. Careful with lambchop."
"If we mess this one up,"
wong will have our hides.
No kiddin'.
"Last time I brought him the wrong tea,"
he turned me into an ottoman.
Daolon wong: Minions!
Have you claimed my talisman power?
Wrapped in wool and ready
"for winter, d-master."
"Uh, it's just hard to lift"
when it's sleepin'.
"It is not sleeping, you fools!"
It has released its astral form!
Uhh!
Ohh!
Heads up.
Aah!
Uhh!
The sheep!
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Big d! Hiya!
"Uh, we're pumped for round 2."
Daolon wong: I have no further use
for those who allow themselves
to be waylaid by unconscious livestock!
So...
We're free to go?
"Uh, when the wongmeister said"
"he had no further use for us,"
you think he meant today?
Or forever?
"Ohh! Why are we leaving the sheep here, uncle?"
Sheep not important.
Astral form is.
That is where the power lies.
So we just wait here
for Casper the friendly ram to trot home.
No.
We must find its astral form
before daolon wong does.
How will we find an astral sheep
if we cannot see it?
With proper eyewear.
(Reciting incantation)
Awaken from shadow.
Serve your new master.
Take this...
And bring the astral sheep to me.
Cool specs!
They're better than 3-d.
Ohhh.
"They are 4-d, Jade,"
and they are not a toy.
"If I were an astral sheep, where would I go?"
Lookin' for some astral turf?
Hot-cha!
Sheep flies this way!
(Man snoring)
Sheep has entered Shepherd's head.
Why would a sheep do that?
To drop in on a dream.
"I was astral once, remember?"
We must maintain contact.
(Reciting incantation)
"Whoa, uncle!"
Your spells keep getting more awesome!
Must keep up with forces of darkness.
"Tasty grub you're serving here, laddie,"
though it's not as filling as the real McCoy.
"Say,"
what's this I hear about shaving me in winter?
Talking sheep?
Cool!
Uh-oh.
Jade: Shadowkhan.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
All: Aah!
What's happening?
Who invited ninjas?
Aah!
(Gasps) The cube of tang shan!
It absorbs astral forms.
The shadowkhan are working
for daolon wong?
"Larry, moe, and curly"
must be on spring break.
I am needed.
I'll cover you. Wha--
too dangerous.
Grrr!
"Eh, you wouldn't hit a guy wearing glasses,"
would you?
Grrr.
Now we are even Steven.
The astral form did not return to its body.
Poor fella's probably scared.
"What do we do now, uncle,"
lead it back with an astral sheepdog?
We talk sheep.
Ohh. No exit.
And no magazines.
Maybe the wong-man's just tryin'
to make a point.
I bet he calls us back any minute.
Yo!
We're waiting!
Wanna play charades?
Well?
Ohh! Why is good help so hard to find?
Jade will lure the astral sheep
to her dream
so that she may communicate with it.
"Uncle, even if the sheep returns,"
the shadowkhan may be right behind.
"You're right, Jackie."
Why don't <i> I</i> mix it up
with the legions of darkness
while <i> you</i> get some shuteye?
"You are the first line of defense,"
"and, failing that,"
shadowkhan cannot physically penetrate
a tae ho han circle
as long as Jade sleeps.
Ohhh.
Time to count sheep.
(Snoring quietly)
Jade as sheep: Baa! Baa!
(Snoring)
Uncle!
(Clicks tongue)
I haven't seen you before.
I'm baaab.
"I'm Jade,"
and I'm not from around here.
Yaa! The old wolf in sheep's clothing ruse!
'Cept I'm no wolf.
"You have to trust me, baaab."
"You're in danger,"
and the only way I can help is
"if you get back to your body, asap."
"Now, where's the fun in that?"
I like flying about.
You won't be flying for long
if those guys in black pjs get a hold of you.
"I'll explain everything on the way to section 13,"
where you can mingle with other exceptional animals
like yourself.
This section 13 is like a club?
A very elite club.
12 members only.
I thought the shadowkhan couldn't penetrate your circle!
They have entered Jade's dream
through the shadow realm.
We must wake her. Uhh!
"Uncle, I can't penetrate your circle!"
Uh...
Might I request bagpipes be played
"at our dream funeral, Lassie?"
"Oh, no! The loch ness monster!"
Didn't think that thing existed.
"It does in my dream. Now, hurry!"
We'll meet you back at your body
in 2 shakes of a lamb's tail!
Let's move.
Ahh.
"Come on, uncle!"
(Wheezing) You two run.
Uncle - will power walk.
(Gasps) Ohh!
(Chants)
The power of astral projection
now belongs to me.
Tsk! That didn't hurt one bit!
Hee-yah!
Ha ha ha!
"Jade, get back here!"
We must return to our--ohh!
Uhh! Uhh!
A little finishing spell
to seal your human forms
makes both of you as good as ghosts.
Ha ha ha!
Jackie!
No sleeping!
"No ""ow""?"
"Uncle, we're right here!"
Hello? He can't see or hear you.
Then how will he know where we are?
(Gasps)
Daolon wong now possesses the power
"of astral projection,"
which he has inflicted upon Jackie and Jade
and then applied a finishing spell
so that they cannot return to their bodies!
And you doubted him.
Returning astral forms to your bodies
will be very complicated.
(Reciting incantation)
Ohh.
It worked?!
"Jade's voice: Uncle, you rock!"
Now let's find daolon wong
and kick some shriveled--aah!
Jade's voice: Why are there 2 of me?
Jackie's voice: W-why is your voice
coming out of my body?!
Aah! Aah!
I told you spell complicated.
"Jackie's voice: Uncle, you returned our astral forms"
to the wrong bodies!
You must switch us back!
No time.
"With the power of the sheep,"
daolon wong can travel the astral plane
and easily seek the location
of the other talisman powers.
Jade's voice: Hyah!
Hyah!
Jade's voice: I'm ok with this.
The moth indicates
that the sheep's power lies in there.
Jackie's voice: There is only one way inside.
Jackie's voice: Ohhh. Uhh!
Jackie's voice: Eh. I forgot who I wasn't.
"Jade's voice: Tryin' to do this, Jackie?"
"Jade's voice: Cool, huh?"
Jade is better at being you
"than you, Jackie."
Jackie's voice: Ohhh.
Jade's voice: Yoga?
Daolon is in a trance.
Jade's voice: The better to turn his lights out!
"No! His astral form wanders,"
but the sheep's is trapped within.
I must free its astral form
before daolon wong's returns.
(Blowing)
"Jackie's voice: Jade, how do you keep these"
out of your eyes?
Jade's voice: Uh-oh.
"Jackie's voice: Stay back, Jade."
"Jade's voice: Yes, <i> Jade,</i>"
maybe you <i> should</i> stay back.
Jackie's voice: Uh...
"Ok,"
but I am giving you permission
to defend us--(Blows)-- This one time only.
Jade's voice: I'm gonna do you proud.
Hee-yah!
(Reciting incantation)
Jade's voice: Oohh.
"Jackie's voice: Ooh, I'm going to feel that tomorrow."
Jade's voice: Ooh!
Now I know why he does that.
Jade's voice: Who da man?
<i>I</i> da man!
Wha--
heh. You wouldn't hit a little girl?
"Jackie's voice: Tsk. When in Jade,"
do like Jade.
Hee-yah!
Jade's voice: Cool!
"Jackie's voice: Jade, do not try that at home."
"Jackie's voice: Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
(Chanting)
"Jackie's voice, gasping: Oh, no!"
The loch ness monster!
"Jade's voice: Nightie night, ninjas."
Jackie's voice: What do you know?
I made them look.
(Chanting)
Baa!
The sheep has been released.
Phthht!
Huh? (Gasps)
"Jackie's voice: But, uncle, what about him?"
Uhh!
Daolon wong is not the only one
with recipe for finishing spell.
Grrr.
Shadowkhan--pah!
Gan! Ren! Chui!
"Big d! Dude, I knew you'd take us back!"
Did you lose weight? Looks good!
You should apologize to us.
I will pulverize you
if you do not assist me
in reversing the old man's finishing spell!
Apology accepted. Works for me.
Mm-hmm.
"Jade's voice: So, uncle,"
can I keep the skin a while longer?
If Jackie agrees to do your homework
in the meantime.
"Jade's voice: Please, Jackie?!"
"Jackie's voice: Eh, no, Jade, you cannot."
Jade's voice: Ohh!
"Hey, Jackie? What's your favorite dessert?"
Ice cream with tiramisu.
I eat everything.
I eat all junk food.
"Ice cream, tiramisu,"
"ice cream, tiramisu."
"But, most important, exercise."
"Exercise--you can beat all the calories, all the bad food."
"According to our GPS unit,"
we are directly in the heart of the Sahara desert.
"Heh. Wyoming is not in Africa, is it?"
Hmph! Technology!
Carrot will tell us when we are near.
So where in yellowstone park
would a talisman-powered rabbit hide?
It's gotta be in one of these giganto rabbit holes.
"Jade! Yeah, yeah, I know."
(As Jackie) You are supposed to be on the tour.
"No, Jade! Those are not rabbit holes!"
"""Danger! Geysers""?"
(Rumbling) Uh-oh.
(Grunting)
"Jackie, I'm stuck!"
Grab on!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
"(Gasps) Jackie, dark warriors ho!"
"Finn: D-master wong wants the power of superspeed, chan."
So hand over the bunny pronto!
But we haven't even found it yet.
Be that way.
(Gasp)
Aah!
Whoa! Timber!
Jade!
"Uh, ratso?"
Aah!
Nice catch.
"Oh, thanks. That was close."
Hey!
Come on!
So the dark warrior wants a piece of unc--aah!.
(Chuckles)
A geezer in a geyser.
Jackie!
Stay in here.
Oh!
Hmm.
Unh!
I'll teach you to mess with Finn 2.0.
Whoa!
(Chanting)
And I will teach you to mess with uncle original recipe.
Heh. Occupied.
Oh!
So that's where you're hiding Peter cottontail.
"You caught me, Sherlock."
Ooh.
Short ears.
Uh...
Yours?
(Snarling)
Aah!
Yup. That'll leave a mark.
(Rumbling)
Aah!
"Sayonara, chan."
Huh?
Finn: Gah!
"You mean, ""cowabunga."""
"Come on, uncle."
"Something tells me we are close to finding our rabbit, uncle."
Aah! What manner demonic creatures are these?!
Midget deer.
"Uncle, they are rabbits. Ow!"
Rabbits do not have antlers!
"He's right, you know."
"Howdy, folks, and welcome to Douglas, Wyoming,"
home of the jackalope.
"Whatever it is, it's not packin' talisman heat."
(Gasp) It destroyed the locator!
"Uh, sir, I am hoping you can help us."
It is very important that we locate a particular rabbit.
"Heh heh, well, you're barkin' up the wrong tree, partner."
I said this was jackalope country.
"Look, we both know jackalopes are rabbits"
who wear fake antlers for the tourists.
(Chuckles) No sirree.
I assure you that Douglas jackalopes are the real deal.
"Now, that was an ugly thing to do."
"Jade, you know the dark warriors could return at any time."
Uncle and I must search for the rabbit alone.
"But, Jackie, I'm an essential member of clan chan!"
Which is why I am giving you an essential mission.
"Go to the nice library down the block,"
and do your homework.
Ooh. Highly classified.
When is Jackie gonna realize I'm his secret weapon?!
Tch! His loss if he can't figure out
I have a nose for sniffing out magic.
Whoa!
"I got it, coach!"
Psyche!
Good arm.
"Thanks for making me look bad, kid."
"Coach: Hey, chip!"
"Ready for me, coach?"
How about some h-2-0 for the troops?
"Oh, right away, coach."
"Nice work, chip."
"Now, let's get all that equipment stacked nice and neat."
Then can I get in some practice
for the big game tonight?
We'll talk.
Now hustle!
"Hey, sorry I goofed on you back there, chip."
Whatever.
It's tough enough getting coach to take me seriously.
I don't need your help in that department.
"Tch! Listen, chip."
"If there's one rule Jade chan lives by, it's this."
"If coach won't give you a shot,"
you have to put yourself in the game.
You're just a little girl.
What do you know about football?
"Let's just say my coach doesn't always put me in the game,"
but I know you can't make the big plays from the sidelines.
Totally.
"I mean, I'm as good as any of the other players."
"Well, I could be faster."
Faster shmaster.
I can see you've got what it takes.
You can?
Sure thing.
So are you gonna just stand there and look pretty
or are you gonna belt this pigskin to the moon?
Go jackalopes!
"Coach: Hey, chip!"
Huh?
You need me coach?
Yeah. Did you feed lucky?
Ohh.
"Right away, coach."
Lucky?
Our mascot.
"Yeah, we never lost a game he's been at."
The other schools try to steal him just to jinx us.
"Lucky wouldn't happen to be a rabbit, would he?"
Jackalope.
Chip: Mmm.
"There you go, luckster."
"Hmm, can a rabbit wear silly antlers and still be noble?"
Let's find out.
Shoo.
Vamoose!
"Come on, super-speed,"
and you're off.
Activate already!
Oopsy.
(Pants)
"Jackie, I found our bunny."
You--wha-- you did what?
(Sighs)
"Jade, what was the bunny doing at the library?"
Uh--crrrrrr.
"Uh, you're breaking up."
Meet me at the town square--
crrrr--and make it snappy.
Chip!
You need me coach?
You wanna explain that?
Locator carrots also make good rabbit bait.
Jade: Here comes turbo-hare.
Jackie: Got you!
Aaahhh!
Aah! Ugh!
Nooo--oof!
Aah--oop!
Oof!
Ohh.
Whoa!
"Jackie, you are terrible rabbit catcher."
"You have to go about this the right way, Jack-rabbit."
Speed catches speed.
Jade: Go get 'em.
Come to Jackie!
Eeeyaaah.
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Jackie: Yes!
Come to Jackie!
Jackie: Huh?
Daolon wong.
"Daolon: Ah, super-speed."
Chip: I know I shut the cage door.
I bet that Jade girl took lucky.
She's gotta be a ringer for the other team.
"Oh, if coach ever finds out"
"I led her to our mascot,"
I'll be benched forever.
Whoa.
Lucky.
Whoa--agh!
(Chants)
"Sir, you are in possession of"
Warren oates memorial high
football team property.
Haaa! Whoa!
What school are you from?
I will not bring it back later!
Thank you!
How many schools are trying to nab him?
"Because of you, I have lost the rabbit."
(Gulp)
"Um, it's a jackalope."
"Mondo blading, Jackie."
Listen carefully...
Aah! Shoo! (Blows air)
For you will bring the rabbit to me
tonight at the town square.
"Tch! In your dreams, creepopotamus."
"If you do not,"
this child's fate shall haunt your dreams.
(Jade gasps)
Chip!
Jade: Jackie.
It's all my fault.
We have to rescue chip.
"Of course, and we will--ow!"
We cannot hand over the rabbit
to forces of darkness.
"Of course, and we won't."
Jackie?
I just had a light bulb.
"Come on, jackalopes."
We don't need lucky to win.
"Announcer: Touchdown, bears."
That chip better find lucky soon.
"Chip: Please let me go, mister."
"The game already started,"
"and it's homecoming,"
and this could be my--
silence!
If I must hear about
your cursed big chance once more--
Jackie: Daolon wong.
Hand over the boy.
Not until you deliver the power of the--
that is not the rabbit.
"Uh, yes, it is."
Then why does it not move?
"Um, it is napping?"
(Chants quietly)
Wake up!
See? It moved.
"If this is indeed the rabbit,"
why does my scepter not glow bright red?
Um.
Because it is really a jackalope.
Aiyaah! Whoa! Bwaa!
(Chants rapidly)
Huh?
"Jackie, what's taking you?"
"Jade? You are supposed to be at the motel,"
guarding the--
rabbit.
Daolon: Hoo!
"No sweat, Jackie."
"As long as I have the rabbit,"
old rigor mortis can't catch me.
"don't worry, chip."
You're in good hands.
So you did kidnap lucky.
It was me or the forces of darkness.
Duh.
Yaah!
Lucky's more than lucky.
He's magic.
Jade: I'm greased lightning.
Jade!
Whoop! Ooh!
Jade.
Give me that.
Chip: Hand-off.
Time to put myself in the game.
"No, wait!"
Ball hog.
Grrr!
Both my running backs are out of the game?
"Ready for me now, coach?"
What do I have to lose?
"Only one way we can win this one, lucky."
"Announcer: Touchdown, jackalopes."
He's fast.
I knew it. There's chip.
"Jackie, you must retrieve the rabbit."
How can I get near him?
"Oh, wardrobe."
Announcer: Unbelievable!
"Another touchdown, jackalopes!"
"Yeah, chip! That's my boy."
"You know, he's like a son to me."
"Show 'em what you got, chan-man."
Gan! Ren! Chui!
"Hey, football."
"Bonding time, eh, big ""d""?"
We knew you were one of us.
Ugh!
The rabbit.
Let's win one for the wongster.
Go dark warriors.
Grrr.
I will destroy you.
"Uncle, singsong: Hey, ugly!"
(Daolon and uncle chant)
Hey!
"Chip, please give me the rabbit."
No way. I'm on a major streak here.
"Listen, you are in grave danger."
Hike.
Time-out.
Baaahhh!
He's going the wrong way.
Who is that guy?
(Chants) (Chants)
"Uh-oh, uncle needs an assist."
"Hey, girls, wanna learn a new cheer?"
(Pants)
Huh?
Whoa-oh.
Chip!
Jackie: Buh!
Dah! Egh!
Yaah!
Sorry.
That's not how I drew up the play.
"Uh, I don't have the ball, guys."
But you do have Mr. floppy ears.
Chip: Baaah!
Oh ho ho.
Ohh.
Lucky?
Fumble!
Catch!
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
"Please do not run, little bunny rabbit."
Come to Jackie.
It's ok.
Good bunny.
"Give me a ""d""!"
"""D""! ""D""! ""D""!"
Give me a <i> zho!</i>
<i>Zho!</i> À <i> zho!</i> À <i> zho!</i>
"Put that together, and what do you have?"
(Cheering in Chinese)
Erggghhh.
Urggghhh.
Gaah!
"Go, jackalopes."
"Jade, where's lucky?"
There's only 10 seconds left in the game.
"Lucky's taking 5, chip,"
but that's all right
because you don't need no stinkin' rabbit.
You can win it on your own.
You think?
I know.
"Now go out there, show us what you're made of,"
and win one for the jadester.
"Hey, buddy, that's our mascot."
"Uh, you must be mistaken."
No antlers.
Quarterback: Hike.
(Slow motion) He's gonna make it!
Crowd: Chip! Chip! Chip!
Chip! Chip! Chip!
Chip! Chip! Chip!
Player: You the man!
"Who knew you had it in you, son?"
Let's try starting you in the next game.
"Aw, keep your rabbit."
That kid's my good luck charm.
"Yep, he's a chip off the old block."
"Hey, Jackie, how many push-ups do you do a day?"
There's a lot of things to train.
"Push-ups, lift-ups,"
"kicking, punch,"
30 each for 6 times.
"It's not like I can do 1000 push-ups, then what?"
"After you do 1000 push-ups,"
you can't. You cannot do anything.
"Sir, security confirms worldwide airspace clearance for tonight's flight."
Transport reports donner and blitzen
"are acting up, your jolliness."
Ho ho ho ho.
"Oh, those rascals always get the jitters"
before showtime.
And the toys?
Wrapped and ready to deliver.
(Hissing)
Unh! Aah!
"Oh, my."
Code red.
"If you've come for a gift,"
"well, I'm afraid you've just made the naughty list."
"Your <i> chi</i> is the only ""gift"" I require."
Elvin: Secure Santa! Huh?
Ooh!
(Door closes and locks)
Elf magic!
Elves: Aah! Unh!
Elves: Aah! Unh!
(Alarm ringing)
Second wave! Go! Go! Go!
I see I shall have to unwrap my present later.
Elves: Unh!
"Oh, my."
"And to all, a good night."
(Daolon laughs)
Thank you! Merry Christmas!
Bye-bye! - Hee hee hee hee hee!
Are you sure uncle isn't running a fever?
"Jade, uncle loves Christmas."
It is when sales are best. Ow!
Commercialism not important!
Christmas spirit is.
Ahh...Mother's recipe.
Yes. And we will be so happy to see her
"for the holidays, tohru."
¶ We-ird ¶
"we must leave some out for ""you-know-who."""
Who?
"Oh! I mean, um..."
I am sure Santa will be very hungry tonight.
"Tch. Nice try, but I'm old enough"
to know the lowdown on the kris kringle scam.
Jade! You do not believe in Santa claus?
<i>Sure</i> I do.
Just like I believe in the tooth fairy.
"Right, Jackie?"
Gotcha!
I told you the tooth fairy was sick
and I was filling in.
Tooth fairy does not exist!
Ha! See?
But Santa claus does.
I have <i> research</i> to prove it.
(Doorbell rings)
Mommy!
Mmm! Aah!
Captain black!
I am sorry.
"That's all right, tohru."
I'm often mistaken for elderly Japanese women.
Good tidings to my favorite unofficial agents.
"Please tell me you found <i> ultramoose ii:</i> À <i> antler gear solid,</i>"
yellow version.
"I've called on all of section 13's resources,"
but the game is sold out everywhere.
"Oh, Jade will be so disappointed."
(Doorbell rings)
Mommy!
Negatory.
(Gasps) How may I help you?
"Name's elvin: Head of security, north pole."
Whoa. You guys are really going all out
"to convince me, aren't you?"
I need your help.
The big red one has been abducted.
(All gasping)
Haven't I seen you in homeroom?
"If what you say is true, uh, elvin,"
why come to us?
Not you. The magic man.
Pulled your credentials from the nice list.
Very impressive.
We have reason to believe you may know the perp.
Creative services handcrafted this likeness.
(Gasps) Daolon wong!
"Oh, he's good."
But what would daolon wong want with Santa?
"Uh, revenge for years of coal?"
Jade: Duh. Wong's part-grinch.
He wants to ruin Christmas!
Not that Santa's for real.
"He may not be real for long if we don't find him, ma'am."
Daolon wong wishes to possess
the extraordinary good <i> chi</i> belonging to Santa claus.
Tch! Like Santa's Chinese.
"""Chi"" is a universal life force"
"which goes by many names,"
as do its 2 sides:
"Yin and Yang, dark and light,"
naughty and nice.
"Yes, well, this wong character vanished"
"with the big cheese, house and all."
We can't get a bead on their whereabouts.
I'll put all - of section 13's manpower
on this right away.
No! Magic must find magic.
"I will cast a locator spell,"
but I require an item belonging
to Santa claus.
"All his gear is up at the pole,"
including an empty sleigh
and toys that won't get delivered tonight
if we don't act quickly.
But what about mommy?
"I'll wait here for her, tohru..."
"Provided ""sensei"" thinks I can handle it."
Tch. And how are we supposed to get
all the way to Santa's workshop
in time to save Christmas?
Whoa.
(Elves chattering loudly)
(Gasps)
Tell me it's the rescue team.
Check.
Thank goodness you're here.
"Mrs. claus phoned from the Bahamas,"
and we had to make like everything was ok
so she wouldn't worry.
Enough chitchat! Uncle needs ingredients!
Santa's workshop.
He <i> is</i> for real.
"There's no margin for error, guys."
"If we're gonna save Santa, we need more muscle."
"Oh, she's having one of her moments."
We need...The j-team!
(Indistinct chatter)
"So after the dot-com bust, uh-huh."
I moved my money into solid blue chip stock
uh-huh. Like pharmaceuticals.
Excuse me.
Jade?
How did you--
you brought an elf to a hanukkah party?
"Viper, here's the skinny:"
The team's on a rescue mission.
The stakes: Kris kringle himself.
Sounds festive.
I'll grab a costume change.
Are you guys in or are you out?
You can depend upon <i> El toro fuerte.</i>
"And paco, too."
"All right, team."
Let's just hope Santa's still packing his <i> chi.</i>
(Gasps)
"Forces of darkness, spring forth..."
And Pierce the veil of elf magic!
"Oh, dear."
Mrrr!
"Strange friend,"
your desire for cheese
will not prevail against good.
"<i>Chi,</i> not cheese!"
There must be a weak spot.
Daolon: Hmm?
Of course.
"Keep 'em moving, keep 'em moving."
Santa <i> will</i> return...
Won't he?
Uncle needs egg of sparrow!
Saliva of eel!
Foam of goat's milk!
(Groans)
Not foamy enough!
And bring snake tails!
From real snakes!
"Uh, force of habit."
Do you want me to locate Santa claus?! Yes?!
Then where is personal item belonging to him?!
Will these do?
Hot cha!
"If you elves have all this hocus-pocus,"
why don't you guys deliver the gifts?
"Tradition. We need reindeer, a sleigh, and a Santa."
"All things considered,"
maybe it's time to find a stand-in.
It takes a <i> very</i> big man
to fill - the big man's shoes.
How big we talkin'?
"Oh, no."
Daolon: Whoa! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
(Chanting)
"Oh, dear."
Lookin' slick for a trick St. Nick.
Oh...I have a bad feeling about this.
So do I. This is highly irregular.
So is Christmas morning
with no gifts under the trees.
(Reciting incantation)
Oh!
The himalayas!
We have underwear on the move.
That is where we will find Santa claus!
Grab some winterwear. We're moving out!
"Jade, I know you want to come, but it is far too dangerous."
And miss the joyride of a lifetime?
We are Santa's helpers!
Ho ho <i> ho!</i>
No accent on 3.
"It's just, ""ho ho ho."""
"Jade: Come on, sumo claus."
Let's see what this baby's got under the hood.
don't forget the nice list!
Uh...Giddyup.
"Tch. On, dasher, on, dancer,"
"on, prancer, on, ViXen!"
Tohru: Uuhh!
Whoa! Oh!
"Tohru: On, donner, on, comet,"
"on, cupid, on, blitzen!"
Mommy?!
Jackie: You could not get us any closer?
Elf magic won't pop the bubble.
A dark <i> chi</i> àforce field.
How do you suggest we shake up this snow globe?
Jade: First stop... 26 maple street.
Down the chimney you go!
"Hit it, t!"
But...I am not chimney-friendly.
Eh--wu--oh!
Mmm...
Cookies.
Child: Daddy! A fake Santa's eating Santa's cookies!
"Come here, you!"
Comet and cupid got your back.
(Chanting)
"Please, please... Think of the children."
Ahh...
Your pleas are fruitless.
"For my soul, dear kringle,"
is as black as coal.
(Chanting evilly)
(Chanting)
(Chanting evilly)
(Singsong chanting)
Ooh...Ee...
Fa la la la la la la la la.
All: Whoa!
<i>Chi...</i> Be mine!
All: Aah! Huh?
Ooh... Ooh... Oh...
All: Santa claus!
(Grunt)
"Rescue team, sir."
(Hisses) Haaaah!
Arrrgghh!
Juarez piledriver!
"Oh, my."
Oh... Sorry.
Ho ho!
No more dark barrier.
How many deliveries have we made so far?
3. Only...
That many more to go.
(Groans) Ohh... I'm a very bad Santa.
Whoa!
"Let's get you home, sir."
Uh!
(Gasps)
Elf...Or garden gnome?
Abominable snowmen.
Attack!
"Santa: Oh, my."
(Chanting)
Jackie: Huh?
(Both chanting)
Mistletoe!
Aah!
Made you look!
Yeee-aaahh-ha!
Aah!
Watch as angels lose their--
(sleigh bells) Huh?
"Jade: Deck his halls, boys!"
Aah!
Jade: Snow angel! Cool!
Code red.
(Hisses) Haaah!
"Transport, I need - a pickup on Santa's house..."
Asap.
Your sleigh.
"Should I need assistance in the future,"
"I hope your fine services will be available, old chum."
I...Would be honored.
Ha. Had to check.
Ho ho ho! Splendid!
"Thank you, everyone!"
"Oh! Only 3 stops? Oh, dear."
We must boogie.
Hah!
Ho ho ho!
Ho ho ho ho!
I come to visit son at Christmas
and spend all my time talking to a stranger!
And talking... And talking...
Tohru was very busy substituting for Santa claus!
I know.
I am so proud of him!
One more thing.
Uh...
Oh! Billy goat!
(Gasps)
My first mask!
"(Chuckles) Wear it proudly, paquito."
I shall never remove it!
"Closer together, and..."
(Jade gasps)
Mistletoe!
Pucker up.
Say <i> chi--</i> ooh!
"Hey, it's for me!"
"Uh, Jade, with all of the excitement,"
I'm very sorry--
I did not have time to complete the quest for your...
It's from Santa!
<i>Ultramoose ii:</i> À <i> antler gear solid!</i>
Yellow version.
How did he know?
"Come on, Jackie. He's Santa claus."
(Everyone chattering)
"Ok, everybody. Group hug!"
All: Merry Christmas!
"Hey, Jackie, what's your favorite food?"
I eat everything.
"I only tell people, try it before you don't like it."
You have to try the food.
"""Ooh! What's that? It smells, stink!"""
It's not polite.
"Eat first. ""Oh. That's not good for me. Ok."""
"For me, I eat everything. Yeah."
(Alarm rings)
(Sirens)
Blast!
Blast!
Ugh!
"Me, valmont, mastermind of the dark hand,"
fleeing authorities like a common--
both: Oof!
You! You!
The supplies for my locator spell!
You shall suffer for what you have done!
What I have done?
You transformed my enforcers into samurai zombies!
I've been reduced to performing my own dirty work.
"Return Finn, ratso, and chow to me at once!"
Heh! Why would daolon wong heed the demands
of an insignificant pickpocket?
Uh...Because I'm bigger than you!
Oh?
Aah!
Heh! Not anymore.
Blaaast!
Come on.
No!
"The whole time we've been in America,"
I haven't grown one inch.
"I'm never gonna grow up, Jackie!"
"Patience, Jade."
Enjoy your childhood while it lasts.
"Tsk! I've a billion years of school left,"
"I can't reach anything in the freezer,"
and I never get invited on your missions.
Way enjoyable.
Uncle: Hot cha!
(Whinnying)
Uncle's locator spell is complete.
"The horse is somewhere in London, england."
(british accent) Cheerio! Either of you chaps
fancy a spot of tea before we hop across the pond?
Captain black has a jet waiting for us.
And he's agreed to look after Jade.
(british accent) What?
"(american accent) I mean, what?!"
"Come, Jackie! We must hurry!"
"Captain black will be here any minute, Jade."
Then I don't have much time.
"Me, valmont,"
forced to ask Jackie chan for help again!
Quickly! We must not let daolon wong
claim the healing power of the horse.
No. We mustn't.
Maybe Jackie'll let me come to London
if this grow-up spell makes me older!
Work already!
"Oh, whatever, I'm going to London anyway."
"Unh! Uncle, have you ever considered"
traveling lightly? Unh!
Uncle is traveling lightly.
Brought only one cauldron.
Jade: Unh! Nngh!
It may not be first class...
Valmont: Ow!
Aah! Aah!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing small?
"Captain black, is Jade staying out of trouble?"
"Uh, actually..."
(Muffled) What?! Where did she--ow!
Whoa! Whoa!
Ohhh.
"Heh heh! Hey, Jackie."
"Uh, she's with me."
Brilliant! Now I have a paper cut!
"Ohh! Tohru, it is your former boss!"
"Uh, half of him."
Valmont? What happened?
"Well, how should I know? I must have nicked it"
on one of the codger's confounded books.
"Boy genius, what happened as in"
how come you're suddenly ordering off the kid's menu?
"Ohh, it's - humiliating, really."
That batty old wizard cursed me!
Oh! Daolon wong!
But the horse talisman will heal me.
Tsk! News flash!
The talismans are history.
The horse we're after is an animal.
"You'd best watch your tone with me, child!"
"Why should I, <i> child?</i>"
B-b-because I am bigger than you!
Ohh.
(Chanting)
"While uncle and I search for the horse,"
you two will wait here and stay out of trouble.
Ohhh.
"Now see here,"
just because I look like a child
doesn't mean you can treat me like one!
I am treating you like a criminal.
Tohru will treat you like a child.
"Now, are you going to be a good little boy?"
"¶ You're not the boss of me, you're not the boss of me ¶"
ohhh. Please behave.
And Jackie thinks I'm a handful.
(Crash)
"So, will you take me to chan,"
or shall I ring room service for some dessert?
Grrr.
"Tsk, tsk. I'm just a child, remember?"
"So am I, remember?"
"Now, tell tohru you're sorry."
Why should I?
Because I'm bigger than you!
Ohh! You are!
I am?
2 whole inches! I'm getting older.
My grow-up spell's working!
Grow-up spell?
"Well, why didn't you say something?"
I command you to cast this spell on me immediately!
You don't own me. Do it!
No! Yes!
Never! Now!
(Rings)
"No dice! Why, you--"
"hello? Jackie, you are at the kempton racecourse?"
I'm just waiting for uncle to pick a noble winner.
(Chanting)
How are things at day care?
Fine. Bye.
"Call Jackie back. Now that I'm older,"
he'll probably want me to help.
Hmm.
Where's valmont?
"Where to, little man?"
"Kempton racecourse. And if you call me that again,"
I shall have you eliminated.
Remain here. I will find him.
But my grow-up spell--
I'll be of voting age before you know it.
No.
Tohru...
Do I look older to you?
Tsk!
This is <i> so</i> ànot the growing up I had in mind.
"But spell or no spell, we gotta grab valmont."
Unh!
"Please, just stay in the room."
"Uh, don't think I can."
Royal medicine?
See? That is the healer we seek.
Whoa!
Heh! I'm big-boned.
"Jade, I promised Jackie that I would keep you our of trouble."
Tsk! It's just not fair
that valmont gets to play and I don't.
"Sorry, t!"
Ohhh.
Children.
Announcer on p.A.: All jockeys and horses
"to the starting gate, please."
Prepare to race!
Gan! Ren! Chui!
I'm Finn. He's ratso. That's chow.
Would it kill you to learn our names?
The horse!
"Ok, stretch. Get off your high horse--"
"unhand me, you buffoons!"
Whoa! It's big v!
And he's mini.
"Indeed. I attempted to liberate you three,"
and that rancid prune of a wizard
burdened me with this... Juvenile curse!
Ohh! You tried to rescue us?
Aww!
We didn't know you cared.
Forget the child! Claim the horse!
"Uh, I saw it first?"
"If you are here, where is Jade?"
Being humongous rules--oof!
Except for the low overhang problem.
Jackie! Stop horsing around!
You will not survive
my fiery stare--oh!
See what you've reduced me to?
I'm helping chan--uhh!
"Be careful. I have a paper cut, you know."
A mere flesh wound is the least of your worries.
(Dark warriors shouting)
"Finn: - Ease up, sweaty."
No one touches little v with us around.
At least valmont bothered to learn our names.
And he's so cute now...Boss.
I am not your boss.
Waah!
I am your master!
Dark warriors: Aah!
"Finn: Yes, master!"
"Chow: We'll be good, master!"
Giddy up!
(Warriors moaning)
Fetch!
"Yes, master!"
"You got it, master!"
"Whatever you say, master!"
You three are pathetic!
Announcer on p.A.: And they're off!
Aiyaaaa!
Clancy's brown fancy out in front
"with little blue sue moving to the inside,"
but...What's this?
Royal medicine is taking the lead
with 2 jockeys.
Please tell royal medicine's owner
"I will send him a check, thank you!"
Astonishing!
Royal medicine has now left the course entirely
with...It would seem...
Circus clowns in pursuit.
Jade? Jade?
Jade!
Whoa!
(Big Ben chimes)
"Well, at least I'm getting to see lon--ohh!"
You will pay for that!
"Nice shooting, part--naah!"
"Well, isn't that just dandy?"
"The one time I want chan to win,"
he makes a hash of it!
Ha ha ha!
"With the power of healing,"
I shall become invincible--eh?
Say hello to my friend flicka!
Aah!
Grrr!
Ohh! Aiya!
Jade?!
"Whoa, there, little fella. It's ok. Shh."
Jade! What happened to you?
Attack!
Talk later!
Wahh!
"You're going down, queen Kong!"
"The bigger they are, the harder they--"
they didn't see that coming?
Honestly! Why did I ever want them back?
Just call me Jade-zilla.
You will give me the horse.
"Try and take it, <i> tiny.</i>"
Oh? Perhaps you should be picked upon
by something your own size.
Big trouble.
(Roars)
"Jade, step away from the ogre!"
"So you can take him on, tom thumb?"
"With the healing horse in my pocket, I can't get injured."
"Ok, handsome,"
this town ain't big enough for the both of us.
"Be careful, Jade!"
The best offense is a good--ohh!
My kingdom for that horse!
I will not endure another moment of immaturity.
Hee-yah!
Grrargh! Hmm?
(Chanting)
Stone magic?
I shall immobilize you first!
(Chanting)
(Both chanting)
(Both mumbling)
"In case of emergency, use the fire escape."
"Valmont, come down!"
You are going to get--ohh!
Ohh--oop!
Aah! Aah!
Nngh! Mmnhh!
"Well, this is a demolition site."
Got you!
Ohh! My paper cut!
"Oh, sorry!"
Tricked you! The wound is on my finger.
"Tsk! I'm packing horse power, which means..."
¶ You can't hurt me! ¶
aah! Unh!
Tally ho!
(Neighs)
(Gulps) Now you can hurt me. Whoa!
(Both grunting)
Rrgh! Hands off Mrs. ed.
"Right then, break the curse."
Make me big! Squander my youth!
"Come on, heal me!"
That's it? - You healed my paper cut?
"I am still a child, you incompetent nag!"
Let me go!
(Muttering)
Looks like you're gonna need a bigger ogre.
And it looks like you are going to need
"an antidote, Jade."
Ohhhh.
(Mumbling)
I'm not the only one.
Valmont: Hello!
Take your blasted pony!
Just get me down from here!
"Sorry I got too big for my britches, t."
"Valmont: Chop-chop, old man!"
"I'm not getting any younger, you know."
Manners! Or uncle will put you back in diapers.
"Ohh, all right, then."
Daddy's little boy is all grown up!
Ta-ta! Must make up for my wasted youth.
"Lead a life of crime, perhaps."
Valmont...
You're under arrest.
What? No! Reverse the spell!
Please! I demand to be tried as a minor!
"See, Jade? Sometimes,"
it is not good to grow up too fast.
"Hey, Jackie."
Yes?
Do you like to ride a horse?
"Yes, the horse is good."
I just don't know how they can train them.
"It's not a horse anymore, it's like a dog."
It just follows wherever I go.
"I run, he runs, I stop, he stops."
I wish I had one of these kind of horses.
"But now, I'm kind of-- not professional,"
I'm pretty good at it.
[Grunting]
[Grunt] Oh...
"Sensei, perhaps we should rest."
What? Uncle has barely broken a sweat!
Too...Weak.
Can't...Go on.
"Uh, have an energy bar, Jade."
"Can't...Chew,"
no energy.
"Uncle, the high altitude of the himalayas"
requires a slower pace.
But forces of darkness require a quicker pace.
We must find the ox which possesses the power of super-strength
before daolon wong does.
[Gasps]
Locator indicates ox is on opposite side of mountain.
We must go back down and come up other way.
[Both groan]
don't you have a spell
that'll just poof us over there? Anything?
Abracadabra?
Uh-oh!
All: Avalanche!
Come on!
Sensei.
Jackie: A yak?
A super-strong yak.
A yak is a type of ox.
And this yak is the ox we seek.
But why did it plow through the mountain?
He wants my energy bar.
"He must have a super-strong sense of smell, too."
We must bring the ox to the sanctuary of the Ben shui temple
before the forces of dark chi descend upon us.
[Chuckles] Yo!
"Consider yourselves descended upon, gramps."
"You know how much we care about you guys,"
but daolon wong's been riding us
"to get rid of you, once and for all."
We're sure gonna miss ya.
"Say goodbye, chan."
"Uh, goodbye, chan?"
"Uh, where'd they go?"
We blew it! Again!
All in favor of keeping
"this little setback quiet say, ""aye."""
Fools!
Give me just one reason
why I should not destroy you instantly!
"'Cause, things are about to change?"
No more embarrassing defeats.
Cross our hearts and hope to--
aah!
Flying elephant stomps rat!
An intruder?
Hak foo! What brings you to town?
Woodchuck Chucks weasel!
Most impressive.
"Dude, dude, dude, you're making us ook-lay ad-bay"
in front of the oss-bay.
Shark bites bottom-feeder!
I understand you have been seeking
"the powers of the talismans, witch doctor."
"Allow me to suggest you end your quest for the ox,"
as it is a power I intend to obtain.
Ung!
"Then obtain it, dear warrior, for me."
Aah!
Uncle has been devising a spell
to transfer the talisman powers
from the animals we have collected.
"Tohru, as my apprentice,"
you will seek proper vessels
with which to contain the powers.
How about putting the speedy rabbit power
in wristwatch form?
"That way, if you see you're running late,"
boom! You're there!
Or the healing horse thermometer?
"By the time you check your temperature, you're already better."
The sheep-powered pillow...Stay cozy while you astral project.
[Moans]
"Uh, ok, scratch the pillow."
"No, daolon wong is near."
We must protect the ox.
Ox not important. Power within ox is.
I will attempt to keep the magic
from daolon wong's reach by casting new transfer spell.
"May I assist you, sensei?"
"Yes, while I am in trance,"
please keep birds off me.
But where will you transfer the power to?
Uncle?
"Ahh, the power of super-strength."
Olly olly oxen free.
Hyah!
Zhen!
All: Hak foo?
"So, you have met."
Acquaint your friends with the new you.
"With pleasure, master."
Phoenix flies to moon!
Meteor brings mass extinction!
"Jade, please keep the birds off your uncle."
Aw.
Tornado decimates trailer park!
"Oh, boy."
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
Does the good wizard think he will outsmart me?
"I don't know what the anti-uncle's up to,"
but this'll teach him to drop his guard
when Jade is in the house.
Hyah!
Oof!
Huh? Invisible force field? No fair!
[Uncle chants]
[Gasps] Daolon wong!
"Good! You have not completed the transfer,"
nor will you.
Hot cha!
Hyah!
Ooh!
Tohru: Hak foo!
This is where you go poof.
I do not poof.
[Slaps and grunts]
Your turn.
"Hurry, uncle."
"You are headstrong, wizard."
But not for long.
[Chants]
Step away from the yak.
Yes.
What?
The talisman power is no longer here!
Where is it?
"Ooh, outsmarted by the uncster."
Was I?
Jackieeee!
[All gasp]
Your uncster and myself have much to discuss.
Uncle? - Sensei?
Say something! - Wake up!
Wake up!
But how can daolon wong have uncle's head
if uncle's head's still on his body?
"Ah, the dark wizard possesses your uncle's spiritual head..."
Essentially his life force.
"Without it, he is doomed to remain in this dormant state."
We have to rescue sensei's life force!
And we must do so before daolon wong makes it--
"uh, uncle, tell him where he hid the ox's power."
Daolon can't get the power if we find it first.
But we cannot find it without sensei.
The locator was destroyed in the avalanche.
Tch! You're uncle's apprentice.
You'll whip up a new one.
But I have not had much practice at such complicated spells.
Tch! Piece of cake.
"Come on, Jackie, we're goin' head-hunting."
"Uh, Jade, perhaps you should remain here"
and be tohru's apprentice.
"Oh, right."
"Hak foo's, like, all mondo-mega- super-turbo-charged."
Way dangerous.
"Yes, it is."
"So, do you want a piece of uncle?"
I will just require my other pieces first.
"If you ever want to see your pieces again,"
surrender the location of the ox power.
Very well.
You may find what you are looking for
"in a secret place, very close to..."
[Blows a raspberry]
"Fool! The orb of q'uan lo will reveal your secrets,"
exposing those thoughts you hold most dear.
Mung bean sandwich?
Uncle is hungry.
Ha ha! I shall peel back the layers.
What is this?
[Cries]
"Your destiny, evil one."
Pah! I shall travel deeper
into the recesses of your mind.
Yeeeees!
Zhen!
Retrieve the power.
"And, finally, a new cowbell."
Nothing happened.
[Gasps]
"Sir, you are crazy if you think"
big mouth hak foo will obtain ox power.
Oh? And who will stop him?
Jackie!
Your nephew has already demonstrated
that he is no match for my most savage warrior.
Why has your incessant mouth
suddenly grown silent?
"[Imitates uncle] Uh, one more thing..."
Who am I kidding?
Gan! Ren! Chui!
Stop chan!
"Who, us?"
Why don't you ask your precious hak foo?
Why don't I turn you inside out?
We're on it!
"You say, ""jump""..."
"We say, ""how high?""."
"Jackie, you are going wrong way!"
I know where I am going. Wha!
See? Wrong way!
Aah!
Uncle: Stop my head!
Aiyaaah!
Jackieeeee!
My ball!
Catch!
Jackieeee!
Hhbbrrrbbb!
Are you trying to give uncle headache?
I am trying to release you!
The orb is magic!
Magic must open magic!
[Sighs] Of course it does.
"Now, don't worry, t. The tenth try is usually the charm."
"You did it, tohru!"
No. It should only glow when the power is near.
[Both sigh] Ohhh...
Duh!
Unc hid the power
the last place anyone would think of looking!
Himself!
"You<i> did</i> do it, tohru!"
<i>We</i> did it.
Hak foo: Happy time...
Is over.
Leave uncle alone!
No!
"Uncle, why does hak foo have your body?"
Because that is where the power of the ox resides.
Of course it is.
"Sensei, are you all right?"
Does uncle look all right?!
"Quickly, tohru, you must find a spell to release me!"
Uh--m-me?
But isn't it Jackie's turn to cast a spell?
Jackie must retrieve the rest of uncle from hak foo!
"[Gulp] Yes, I must."
Do you have the old man?
"Indeed, master."
Good. My Patience wears thin.
"You will pay for your cleverness, good wizard,"
"for once I absorb the power within you,"
I shall see to it that your spirit head
has nowhere to return.
Tohru: Uh...One pair of dried bat wings.
Check!
Uh...One cedar leaf.
Check.
3 spines of urchin.
Uncle: 3 spines?!
Do you want uncle's head to explode?
But the spell book says--
book is only a guide!
Good chi wizard makes spell his own!
[Groans] Oh...
[Daolon chanting]
"Uh...Wait, uh... Time out!"
"Look at yourself, hak foo!"
Daolon has made you his lackey...His slave.
Is this<i> really</i> <i>how you want to be--</i> <i>a freak?</i>
Yes.
Rrrahhh!
Daahh!
"[Cough, cough, cough]"
Pah!
One more thing...
Be sure cauldron bubbles at proper rate.
One more thing...
Do not forget to channel good chi.
One more thing...
Do not rush chanting!
Release the talking head already
before he comes up with 3 more things!
[Inhales]
[Chanting]
[Chanting]
Why could uncle not have transferred the super-strength
to<i> my</i> body?
Shall I...Make a wish?
Hot chaaaa!
Huh?!
Pffft!
Hello!
And goodbye!
Aah!
Who wants a piece of uncle?
Aah!
Tyrannosaurus swats fly!
Bbblllbb!
Volcano blows top!
Uncle: One more thing...
Aah!
What do you know? He does poof!
Hey! Welcome to loserville.
"Aw, don't look so sad, big guy."
Yeah. You're one of us now.
[Growls] Shut up!
Strength cannot withstand heat.
Tohru: Daolon wong!
"Go, chi wiz!"
"Well, muscles..."
Perhaps we should get your super-strength back to section 13
while the going is good.
I will transfer the power back into the ox
with tohru's help.
My apprentice will make a fine wizard some day.
[Scurrying sound]
[Chuckles] Yes...
Some day.
"Hey, Jackie, how do you control your anger?"
I always forgive somebody.
"But when I'm young, no, I'm not--"
"they harm me, I harm them back."
"The whole day-- [Breathing hard] ""This guy..."""
No. Right now I just... Forget it.
I really control my anger.
(Chanting)
The 12th and final locator spell
has located nothing.
Duh!
It couldn't find a dragon
'cause they're extinct.
"The only one left on earth was shendu,"
and he's doing afterlife
in the inter-dimensional slammer.
"Jade, we had to be absolutely certain"
that the power of combustion has not found a host.
"With no dragon to inhabit,"
the power remains lost...
Safe from the forces of darkness.
"As long as daolon wong roams the earth,"
nothing remains safe.
"Your answer, most malevolent of fire breathers?"
"It would seem you have summoned me merely to humor me, wizard."
"For to obtain the power of combustion,"
"you would require - a living, earthbound dragon,"
which I am not.
"You underestimate my talents, lord shendu."
"As the most malevolent of dark chi masters,"
"I know a multitude of ancient spells,"
some of which might restore you.
Ah.
"Then you may have my rightful power, daolon wong,"
if you find the spell that will allow me to live again.
Heads up!
Move it or lose it!
"Uh, Jackie?"
"Research, captain black."
We have to be prepared.
With no more talisman-powered animals on the loose--
it's only a matter of time before daolon wong
comes after the ones in the vault.
I'll beef up security and--ow!
Magic must defeat magic!
And the powers will be difficult to safeguard
until they are - transferred from the animals into new talismans.
(Uncle chanting)
The first of the new talismans has been empowered.
All right! Let's beta test--
oh. That was my best one.
The making of a talisman is very tricky business.
The spells which created them
have been lost for thousands of years.
"Hey, Jackie, when uncle gets the powers out of these guys,"
"we still get to keep 'em, right?"
"Jade, the animals have owners,"
or natural habitats.
don't you think we should return them?
"What? No, they're my pets!"
Who has a pet ox?
Can we at least keep scruffy? Please?
He belongs at section 13.
"He's a natural-born crime fighter,"
"and he's already housebroken, and--"
(growls and barks)
And he keeps the neighbors awake with his barking.
(Gasps) Jackie!
(Gasps) A dragon is near.
(Chanting)
"Return to us, shendu."
Rise again!
Jackie: First it says there isn't a dragon. Now it says there is?
Are you sure the locator is working properly?
"Uncle wishes that it were not,"
"but clearly, it guides us."
"If the locator detects a dragon now,"
someone must be conjuring one.
Tch. And I'll give you one guess which someone that is.
"Jade, this is too dangerous."
We could be facing a dragon.
Not just any dragon.
(Gasps) Aiyaa! No.
Jackie: Shendu!
Awaken!
(Chanting)
Uhh!
Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!
Hey!
Backyard barbecue.
What are we grilling?
Jackie chan!
Let's tenderize him.
Volcano incinerates field mouse!
Gotta stop this spell before the barbecue becomes a birthday party.
"You are too late, child."
Urrr--
uhh!
Sorry. Cannot hear you.
You must have a frog in your throat.
(Ribbit)
Ptha!
Cheap tricks.
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
Uhh!
Whoa! Hot--hot-- hot--hot--hot--hot!
"Duh, Jade."
Hurricane kick!
Earthquake fist!
Asteroid belt!
Meteor pummels mountain!
Hot bath?
Cold shower.
(Chanting)
Uhh! Ah! Uhh!
Jackie!
(Daolon chanting)
Aaahhhhh!
"Greetings, everyone."
It is great to be back.
"Yo, shendude."
"Uh, long time no breathe."
Yeah.
"Chui: Happy, uh, re-birthday. Ha ha."
Yes.
My prize approaches.
The power of combustion--
belongs to me!
Mega bad day.
Ahh.
Feel the burn.
Aah! - Aah! Aah!
"But brother of darkness,"
we had an arrangement.
"I may be a noble dragon,"
but I am also a demon sorcerer
and not known for keeping promises.
Aaaahhha.
Quickly! I have a plan!
I still possess 2 talisman powers
with which to destroy you.
(Gasps)
Levitation! Heat-beam eyes!
What thoughtful birthday presents.
No!
Uhh!
"And you will tell me where to retrieve my other powers,"
after I have had the pleasure
of quick-frying Jackie--
uhh...
Jade: Bolting for it?
That was your big plan?
Shendu will attempt to reclaim what once belonged to him.
The other talisman powers.
P.A.: Condition red. Security lockdown initiated.
We're on full tactical alert.
"I know,"
magic must defeat magic.
Which is why you must buy uncle all the time he requires.
Tohru!
Jade! Research!
"You heard him, men. Engage heavy artillery."
"Radar operator: Sir,"
we have a bogey approaching from the perimeter.
A big one.
This is it.
"If the demon breeches the outer defenses,"
we make our stand here.
Protect that vault.
(Explosion)
"Captain black,"
it may not be possible to defend the vault.
Aiyaa!
Cannot find spell I'm looking for!
Uncle needs more time!
I will buy uncle as much time as I can.
Jackie?
(Rumbling)
Hold your positions.
Fire.
"Someone say ""fire?"""
Ahh!
"Surrender the animals, or--"
you want them?
Come and get them.
(Roars)
Stop fooling! Help uncle research!
"Everyone, grab a book."
Nice monkey.
Please climb off my head.
"Power of levitation, right."
Tch. Just be glad he doesn't have super-speed.
Dwah! Jade!
Are you crazy?
"If anything has ever been too dangerous,"
this is it!
"Hey, where my pooch goes, I go."
(Ruff)
Aah!
"I know you are hungry,"
but I need this to drive.
Huh? Dah!
The astral projection talisman.
Jackie!
Not a good time for a nap!
Aahhhhh!
One cannot begin anew
without burning a few Bridges.
Bwaaaaa! - Bwaaaaa!
Shendu's hot on our tail.
We gotta jump it!
It won't go any faster!
Hello? Rabbit power!
Too fast! Too fast!
Aah! - Bwaa!
(Tires screech)
Everybody out! Keep moving!
(Sighs)
At least we put some distance between us and--
aah! - Bwaa!
"Both: Hurry, uncle."
Uncle: Hot cha!
You found a way to take down shendu?
Shendu not important!
"I found way to defeat the person who knows how to defeat shendu,"
even though that person does not yet know he knows.
Jade!
Take the animals!
Run!
Jade: Trying!
Jackie!
Eat heat beams!
(Oink)
(Nervous laugh) Sorry. Wrong pig.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh! Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
"Hey, what do you get when you cross an ox with a rabbit?"
A ram!
Uhh!
Go! Quick! Run!
(Ruff ruff ruff)
Uhh!
(Ruff ruff ruff)
(Gasps) Scruffy! No!
"At last, it is time to reabsorb my powers!"
Daolon: Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!
Prepare for battle!
Wow! - We rock!
I'm feeling prepared!
That thieving lizard shendu
will pay dearly for his betrayal.
(Uncle and tohru chanting)
Going somewhere?
Attack!
(Chanting)
All: Aah!
(Gasps)
No!
We are weak.
We're human.
We're free.
Nah-uh.
Busted.
Uh--
phaa--
wh--(Whimpers)
"Mr. wong, you're under arrest."
"You may be disenchanted,"
but I believe you still know many ancient spells.
I will tell you nothing!
Do you want to have your revenge upon shendu? Yes?
Then start talking to uncle!
(Grumbling)
(Grunting)
And tiger makes 12.
Both: Whoa! Uuhh!
Which means I now possess
so many ways to make you suffer!
"(Crowd, chanting)"
"No! No, not again!"
(Chanting)
Stop!
(Moans)
The extraction spell is working!
The powers are gonna
go back into the animals?
Wait and see.
Aarrrrgghhhhh!
(Cheering)
"Uncle, was that--"
the very same spell which turned shendu to stone ages ago
and separated his powers from him
in the form of 12 talismans.
Courtesy of daolon wong.
(Grumbling under breath)
"Hey, Jack--"
um...Can we keep him?
Who else'll fetch my slippers?
Yes!
But he will have to move out of the vault.
Need to make room for some...New arrivals.
Shendu: Chaaaaan!
"Hey, Jackie, where do you like to go in Hong Kong?"
"If my friend coming to Hong Kong,"
there only few place I can take them...
"Here, my restaurant, across Hong Kong side. Harbor."
Really see beautiful nighttime
and also the mountain.
"Hong Kong's a very, very beautiful place."
"Uncle: Push, tohru!"
(Grunting)
Push!
"Uncle, unlike the ox,"
tohru does not have super strength.
Then help tohru push!
We must leave quickly
before daolon wong's warriors return for the ox.
Maybe this will speed things along.
"Mmm! Crunchy, energizing goodness!"
"Finn: Hey, folks..."
"Hate to interrupt snack time, but--"
fetch!
Huh? Huh? Huh?
I guess one should never come between
a hungry ox and its vittles.
Grrr.
Pterodactyl snatches ox!
Uh-oh.
Aah!
Bwaa!
"To the plane, quickly!"
"Come on, boy!"
Hunh! Huhh!
Thunder fist!
Bwaa!
Huh?
Yah!
"Go, go, go!"
"Uh, what he said."
(Panting)
"Jade: Jackie, come on!"
Hak foo: Tiger lands on eagle's back!
Bwaaa!
Tohru! Help Jackie!
(Gulps) Out there?
(Gulps)
Tohru: Jackie!
Gah! Eee!
Bwaaaa!
Hyuh!
Hit it!
Aah!
(Gasps)
"Jade: Sit back and relax, Jackie."
You've been upgraded to an indoor seat.
Welcome to your new digs.
"Hey, everyone!"
Say hello to the mightiest member of the zodiac gang.
Jade of the jungle.
"Hiya, boy."
This is scruffy.
(Barking)
"Look, scruffy's herding again."
He's gotta be part sheepdog.
Smart doggy.
(Purrs)
And this is Sasha.
She used to be a Vegas show girl.
"Good Sasha, pretty Sasha."
"Ahem. You can finish introductions later, Jade."
It's almost time for school.
(Gasps) School?
"All good things must come to an end,"
even spring break.
"No, I totally spaced!"
I am so in trouble.
Teacher: It seems every other student
managed to prepare an exhibit
for tomorrow's school fair.
"What is your excuse this time, Jade?"
"Um, would you believe I had to help rescue"
a super-strong ox from the dark warriors?
"What, no invisible rabbit?"
"Put a sock in it, drew."
And it's a super-speed rabbit.
"Jade, luckily you still have one day"
"to put an exhibit together,"
which shouldn't be too much of a problem
considering your imagination.
You could always bring your magic animals.
(Students laughing)
"Yes, I could, couldn't I?"
My enemies possess 9 talisman powers
and I only possess 2?
I have you to thank for that.
Hak foo.
Sheesh.
"Get with the program, will you?"
Grrr.
I meant all of you!
Pah!
I must locate the remaining animal
and find a way to tip the balance of power in my favor.
(Hoofbeats)
Hmm?
(Hoofbeats stop)
Good invisible snake.
Rabbit power!
"Easy does it, fellas."
Bwaa!
Jade!
"Oh, can you believe these strays wandered in?"
Section 13 is so turning into a barn.
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
"Oh, Jade,"
have you come up with anything for the fair yet?
I cannot wait to come see.
The f-fair?
"Uh, you really don't want to come."
I don't? No!
"Um, I decided to make an exhibit of..."
"Uh, mashed potato sculptures."
Snoresville. Heh heh.
"Well, uh, gotta cook up some spuds."
Later!
Potato sculptures?
Young Jade has a very unique mind.
"Whew! Ok, haiku,"
change 'em back!
Head count!
"1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4--9."
We're off to the fair.
(Children chattering)
Now remember:
"Ix-nay on the agic-may, ok?"
"If anything goes wrong, uncle Jackie will ground me for life."
No way!
A petting zoo?
Look. don't touch.
Where did you get all of these?
"These, drew, just happen to be the animals I,"
"um, borrowed from my cousin, the zookeeper."
"Hey, these are the magic animals, aren't they?"
"No. I mean, heh heh. You got me, drew."
I was making all that magic stuff up the whole time.
Heh. Heh heh heh. Uh.
Me and my imagination.
"Ahh, yes."
Reveal yourself to me.
Uhh?
The dog?
There must be some mistake.
They are vulnerable again?
Jade will be very surprised to see us.
"Ooh, games."
Who wants to play whack-a-mole?
We are here to whack real animals!
"And this time,"
we will not fail.
"Come on, Jade."
I've never seen a magic animal trick.
"Uh, shouldn't you be annoying people"
"at your own booth, drew?"
(Gasps)
(No audio)
(Woof woof)
"Drew, buddy!"
Hold the fort for me.
"And whatever you do, don't touch anything."
"Sure thing, Jade."
Step right up! Ring the bell!
Pick a prize!
I will win something for Jade.
Pfft. Games are rigged.
Uhh!
(Clang)
Supermoose.
Jade's favorite.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Tohru: Surprising you.
We can't wait to see your potato sculptures.
Potato? Oh! I mean...Uh...
Duh...Too bad you missed 'em!
They were delicious.
Ashley's booth features her key chain collection.
Oof!
(Gasps) Dark warriors!
What are you doing here?
"Come on, bunny."
Show me your tricks.
(Falling bell - whistles through the air)
(People screaming)
Yaaah!
Whoa! I wonder what else
Jade's been saying that's true.
Grrr.
So you have come for the animals?
"Uh, what animals?"
"Uh, yeah. Heh."
I don't see any animals around here.
No! Come back!
Scruffy!
Rahr! Oof!
Rrrr.
Ohh! Dark warrior!
Daolon: Enough dallying. The animals!
Evil on the loose?
Here comes supermoose!
Heh heh.
I bet you're wondering why all the animals--
I know why.
Which way did they go?
Ohh! Every way!
We must split up.
Remain here.
"But, Jackie, there are 9 animals,"
"4 evil dudes, and only 3 of you!"
We need to even things--
"Jade, you have caused enough trouble."
(Sighs)
You're right. I have.
Which is why I need to make things right.
Tourists: Aah! Help!
Let's get outta here!
A tiger!
"(Kissing) Pussy cat, want some fishy-fish?"
Hand me the tiger.
"Funny, I was gonna say the same thing."
Come to papa.
Huh?
"No, no, no!"
Do not eat the astroturf!
"Whaddya know, chan?"
You're on a roll!
Aah!
Aah!
Chow: We're on astral-turf!
No.
I was not expecting to feel that.
Guess it's 'cause we're both astral.
"There you are, little fella."
Come on. Let's get you some cheese.
Eeyah!
Whoa!
Uh-oh.
I will take the rat.
(Supermoose tootles fanfare)
Antler action!
You will take the moose on the jaw!
Grrr.
"You the man, supermoose."
Supernova incinerates super--
"evil on the loose, you do not want to mess with supermoose!"
"Uncle: So, do you want a piece of uncle?"
(Chanting)
Aah!
"Nobody messes with the ""do."""
Ha ha! Time to jet!
He is one slippery character.
"Please, come to uncle Jackie."
Baa!
Baa!
Good sheep.
Huh?
Uncle and tohru are busy devising a locator spell
to find the remaining animals.
Let us hope - that it is not too late.
(Sighs)
"Jackie, I deserve to be grounded for life,"
but I'm hoping you'll settle for a month or 2.
Scruffy!
Scruffy!
Just like I trained you.
But how?
"Told you scruffy was part sheepdog,"
and I taught him the way home.
"Good boy. Good boy, scruffy."
"Jade, would you mind explaining exactly"
what happened at your booth yesterday?
"Uh, would you believe--"
"the dark warriors, like, appeared from out of thin air,"
and--and then the--the magic animals ran off
and turned invisible and stuff!
"Oh, drew. I think you may be spending too much time with Jade."
(Supermoose tootles fanfare)
A flying moose!
"Gee, Ms. hardman, and I thought <i> I</i> had quite the imagination."
"- Hey, Jackie! - Yes."
Have you ever worked with any dangerous animals?
"Oh, yes. I remember when I make the movies,"
it's a leopard. Every time--grrr--
he try to attack me. That is scary.
Then I remember the animal really can recognize the people.
Not everybody. Except me. Only me.
"I don't know why every time the leopard see me, he say attack me."
(Whoosh)
(Gasps) How did--
halt!
Halt!
Uhh!
"Jade: Show me whatcha got, shendu!"
Eat digital steel!
Tohru: No!
"That's right, t."
Another slice of dragon toast for the Jade-ster!
Ohh! My flame-on button keeps jamming!
"Uh...Boys and girls, I am trying to concentrate."
So are we!
"We have to get to <i> medieval evil,</i> level 7!"
Uncle: Forget level 7. We are going to the opera.
Tonight!
"But uncle, my shang dynasty exhibit opens tomorrow."
I am swamped!
Whoa! Opera?
Since when does uncle go for fat ladies in viking helmets?
Not viking opera! Peking opera...
With very special performers.
<i>Seven little fortunes?</i>
"(Gasps) But, uncle, that is--"
the troupe with which I received my opera training.
Sensei?
You were in the opera?
When uncle was very young.
(Laughs)
Then how come I never hear you sing in the shower?
"There's more to the Peking opera than song,"
as you will see tonight.
"Uncle, this must mean--"
yes. My old friend wing is now the director of this troupe...
And I have not seen him in nearly 60 years.
"This is the story of Lao sheng, the farmer."
Lao sheng's beautiful daughter qing yi means the world to him.
"(Atonal) ¶ oh, fair daughter ¶"
¶ our cow is sick and delivers sour milk ¶
"Jade, pay attention like the rest of us!"
(Snores)
(Snorts)
(Sheepishly) Heh! I am multi-tasking.
Now you are one-tasking!
Bwaaa!
"That is 4,000 years old!"
Excuse me!
Pardon me!
(Artifact rolls)
(Gasps) Wing!
(Rolling continues)
"Um, meanwhile..."
"We arrive at the castle,"
"where the villain, also known as the ""jing,"" lives."
Bwaaaa!
Whoa! Where'd Mr. creepers come from?
(Coyly) Uncle cannot reveal old stage secret.
"Uncle: Villainous jing summons a powerful ghost,"
and together they terrorize farmer Lao.
Butt whoop?!
Now you're talkin'!
Jackie: Excuse me.
Oh! Pardon me.
Yes. Very exciting.
Jackie! I'm trying to watch!
Ahh! Everyone's favorite!
The clown provides welcome comic relief.
Audience: Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
And cooler moves than Jackie!
"So, you think uncle's old friend"
"calls him ""uncle,"" too?"
"Chuckles, is that you?"
Chuckles?! Chuckles?!
Beetlebrow!
"So, you remember your nickname for me after 60 years?"
Ha ha ha!
Who can forget those fuzzy caterpillars living over your eyes?
And your never-ending pranks
and gift of laughter.
Is he talking about the same guy?
"So, you have come to see my ""family"" at work."
And to introduce my family to you.
My nephew Jackie...
"Ah, yes! Butterfingers."
"Uh, hello. I have heard so much about you."
I am sorry I have to run.
I am mounting an exhibit at the pacific Asia museum.
Uh...Bye-bye.
Please excuse his manners.
(Proudly) And this is my apprentice tohru.
(Video game pings)
(Clears throat)
This alarm tells me I must tend to the shop now.
A pleasure meeting you.
"And last, but not least, my great-niece Jade."
Jade: Hey!
No trapdoors?
"So, how do you do all that passing-through-walls stuff?"
Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?
True artisans never reveal the secrets of their stagecraft.
"All part of the ""magic"" of the theater."
"Uncle told you so, Jade."
Youthful enthusiasm.
I remember a time when we were brimming with it.
We trained very hard in school...
"Though <i> you,</i> chuckles,"
trained hardest in the art of merry-making.
Ah! So much talent!
You might have become the grandest clown
in this or any other troupe...
But you chose to abandon the magic of the theater
for other <i> kinds</i> of magic...
Turning your back on years of study and brotherhood.
"With great sorrow, brother wing,"
but I discovered my true calling.
Jade: Hmm...
So <i> that's</i> what that's for! Heh!
It would seem your proteges
possess the same lack of respect for the theater as you!
Ohh! Perhaps this is my cue
to again take leave of the opera!
"And this time, it shall be with great pleasure!"
"But, uncle, I never found out"
how they do that secret melting-through-walls thing.
Pfft! A cheap trick called magic makeup!
What?!
(Yawns)
A typo? (Groans)
What?! That is impossible!
Aah!
Uh...Shouldn't you be at the opera?
Another one?
(Grunting)
Waah!
Uhh!
No! Those are priceless!
don't they pay you at the opera?!
(Groans)
Huhh!
Whooo!
Stop!
"Hey, Jackie, trying out for the opera?"
"Jade, what are you doing here?"
"Thought you should know, uncle's not himself."
He and wing-ding had a falling out.
Jackie: Aah! Which beats falling down.
Uhh!
Uhh!
"Jade, stay back! They are thieves!"
don't they pay them at the opera?
All aboard the magic bus.
Jackie: Wait!
(Panting)
Uhh!
Let me in!
Buck fifty.
But they didn't pay!
Let's put a wrinkle in your hocus-pocus!
(Grunts)
"Jade, how did you--"
"Jackie, hit the deck!"
That's gonna leave a mark.
Uhh!
(Sighs) Talk about a hard act to follow.
"Wing: Now, artisans,"
once more from the top.
Ah! Have you returned to apologize for chuckles?
We have returned to accuse your artisans of a crime.
What?!
These two abused theater magic
in order to steal a small fortune
in ancient artifacts from the museum last night.
My performers know better than to use sacred magic
outside the theater!
Perhaps the artifacts are missing
because you dropped them somewhere... Butterfingers.
(Sputters)
Or perhaps we witnessed your ghost suffer a black eye!
Yeah!
Yes! Aha!
Uh...
Heh heh! Heh!
Well?
It did not go well.
"Well, it's obvious"
mega-brow is the ringleader of the gang.
"No! Beetlebrow may be a stubborn,"
"self-righteous, intolerant mule..."
But I know him to be honorable
and incorruptible.
He would never tolerate criminals
"in his company! - But, uncle,"
we saw them!
Promise me you will leave matters to the police.
(Sighs) I promise.
Tch! That makes <i>one</i> of us.
"Uncle, why do you insist on coming back"
if wing upsets you?
Wing not important!
"Uncle likes good opera,"
that is all.
(Clears throat)
Jade has been in ladies' room long time.
Did she fall in?
The stolen loot has to be somewhere on the premises.
Ooh!
Magic makeup.
Cool!
Time to get the goods on the gruesome twosome.
(Footsteps)
(Doorknob rattling)
(Gasps)
(Gasps)
Duh!
"Aw, just that singing farmer."
"Well, do you think the others suspect us?"
Hmm...I am more concerned with chuckles' nephew.
"Wing: Quickly, artisans. Curtain time nears!"
"Besides, any suspicions"
will first lead to our fellow jings.
Just be prepared to grab our cash cow
in the event a quick getaway becomes necessary.
The walls have ears... <i>And</i> eyes.
Jade: Psst!
Down here.
Aah!
Found our crooks.
"Jade, what is going--"
the bad guys only play the villains off-stage.
"On-stage, the bad guys play the good guys!"
"In <i> English,</i> Jade."
Those guys are the thieves.
(Stage performance musical fanfare playing)
Whoa! Talk about your dedicated actors.
"Their ""cash cow."""
That's it!
What is it?
Where they hide the loot.
Come on! They're gonna try and bolt with it!
"Jade, we can't just go out there."
If uncle sees us...
Uncle won't need to know it's us.
You have to be kidding.
"(Atonal) ¶ oh, fair daughter ¶"
¶ our cow is sick and delivers sour milk ¶
what?! It is too early for the clown's entrance.
Uh...
¶ I will take the sick cow to a doctor ¶
I do not recall a second clown in this opera.
¶ The cow will feel better in the castle ¶
these are not the lyrics!
¶ The cow must see a doctor ¶
both: ¶ the castle ¶
¶ a doctor ¶
both: ¶ the castle ¶
Jade: ¶ a doctor ¶
¶ duh ¶
¶ don't you goons know anything ¶
¶ about proper cow care? ¶
who is <i> that?!</i>
Ohh!
Ai-yaaa!
We do not fight a clown in this scene.
"Apparently, I do."
I'm sorry. I will bring this back. Thank you!
"Brother wing, I--"
"so, the prankster takes his revenge on my opera!"
I hope you are happy.
Jade: Uhh!
Audience: Ha ha ha ha!
Your oafish proteges
have dishonored the sanctity of my stage!
(Gasps)
What is the meaning of--
it would seem the sanctity of your stage
has been previously dishonored.
"And so, I take my exit."
Facial!
Uhh!
"Clowning around has its moments,"
but I think I will stick with my calling--
archaeology.
I was blind.
It was <i> your</i> proteges who were the honorable ones.
We rock! Uh-huh!
"I will always wish the opera had kept you, my friend."
And that is my cue to say good-bye.
One more thing.
I hope it will not be another 60 years
"before we meet again, beetlebrow."
"As do I, chuckles."
"Hey, Jackie,"
where did you live when you were little?
My father put me through the martial opera school.
"One thing's difference-- we have to stay there,"
"live there, eat there."
"So many different teachers teach you how to dance,"
"kicking, punch, acrobatic, all kind of things."
"School is very, very important."
Ahh!
Grape and cookies.
Mmm.
Good evening.
"Uh, fudge nutty?"
If you are on a break...
Perhaps someone else can assist me.
I am the only one here.
What exactly are you looking for?
Something like this.
Note the unusual filigree.
"Customer: Rise and shine, my boy."
Where am I?
<i>Who</i> am I?
"You are tohru,"
my most loyal henchman.
"Uncle: Jackie, next time you take Jade to movies by yourself."
"Popcorn stale, sound too loud..."
And story unrealistic.
"Oh, you expected reality"
from <i> brain-draining freaks</i> <i>from planet medulla?</i>
"Hey, I'm sleeping with noseplugs tonight."
No alien's getting its mitts on my brain matter.
(Gasps)
I told tohru never to leave shop door open!
You let mosquitoes in and the air conditioning out!
"Hey, t! You missed a classic."
Jade: Tohru?
Hello?
He probably just stepped out for a minute.
Hmm. Tohru would never leave without writing note.
And he would never leave a cookie uneaten.
Customer: I am valmont.
don't you remember me?
I remember nothing.
Jolly good potion.
It would seem you are the victim of amnesia.
Allow me to fill in some blanks.
"I am the leader of the dark hand,"
"a premiere crime syndicate,"
and you work for me.
Premiere crime syndicate?
"Um, a temporary setback, I assure you,"
but it was only yesterday
that you and I were at the top of our game.
"See? You made the FBI's most wanted,"
3 years running.
"Oh, so it is true. But how?"
Our Nemesis must have throttled you famously
for your entire memory just to up and vanish.
Nemesis?
Jackie chan.
Chan will pay.
"In good time, loyal one, in good time."
"First, we have a very important flight to catch."
(Chanting) <i>Yu mo gue guai fi di ziao.</i>
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i> <i>fi di ziao.</i>
Tohru is there.
How did he get there?
Told you he's been kidnapped.
Let's bring our boy home.
"Master, are there no closer banks for us to rob?"
We have not traveled to Sri Lanka
"for any run-of-the-mill heist, tohru."
We are here for the score of a lifetime.
And the beauty of it?
All we require is your muscle
"and the instructions to a secret location,"
which we are soon to collect.
"Now, be on your best behavior."
"Yes, master."
Chundi!
How my heart soars to see you again.
"Master babur, it pleases me"
to introduce my protg tohru.
"Ah, any brother to chundi"
is a brother to our monastery.
"Tohru, assume lotus position"
while babur and I catch up.
"So, chundi,"
could it be you have finally returned
to attain true enrichment?
"You have a way with words, master babur."
"Then you shall be among the privileged few,"
"the purest of spirit,"
who have communed at the legendary temple.
Your companion is also worthy?
Uhh!
"Oh, yes, indeed."
Tohru possesses great strength--
"uh, inner strength-- of a most spiritual nature."
Then come. Allow me to bestow upon you the directions
to the temple of the golden elephant.
Uncle...
I'm parched.
Can't we just drink it?
We are out of water.
Do you want to find tohru?
Yes?
Then we must not drink locator spell!
"Uh, how about now?"
Unh! Uhh-uhh-uhh!
Tohru!
"Ahh, he is safe."
What's he doing?
It would seem my apprentice seeks inner peace.
"So I will give him piece...Of uncle,"
for making us worry ourselves sick!
And I will fetch us some water.
"Hey, big fella!"
"Remove yourself, child."
"What's with the 'tude, dude?"
I came halfway around the world to find you.
You are lousy shopkeeper!
You leave without sweeping.
Uncle could have slipped on crumbs and broken hip!
"What are you jabbering about, old fool?"
(Gasps)
You speak to your <i> sensei</i> that way?
Ow! Grrrr!
"Tohru, what is with you?"
You...Know my name?
"Uh, Jackie, I don't think tohru recognizes us."
"What? Oh, do not be silly, Jade."
Jackie chan.
See? Tohru knows exactly who I am.
My Nemesis!
Uhh! - Uhh!
Ayah!
"Tohru, it is me, Jackie!"
"Yes, I know. Yaah!"
"Jackie, don't hurt tohru!"
What about me?
Rarrgghh!
"Tohru, whatever I did to anger you I am sorry!"
"Lastly, you will both emerge from the bamboo forest"
to find yourselves at the lake of riddles.
(Crashing)
"Ooh, what was that?"
Whoa! Oof!
Unnnh!
Freak pottery accident.
Frightful how they'll just spontaneously combust.
Shall we press on then?
Tohru: I will crush you!
Uhh!
Tohru is not acting like himself.
"Oh, yes, he is."
His <i> old</i> self.
"Chundi, what are you hiding?"
This is not the behavior of one
who is prepared to visit the temple.
"Which reminds me, left or right at the lake?"
Across.
Oop.
"Thank you, master."
"And now that I have been enlightened,"
let us forget that we ever had this chat.
It's time to jog tohru's memory!
"Tohru, remember all those times"
we butt-whupped the shadowkhan?
The who?
"Uh, ok, never mind them."
"Well, how about the time you helped me get over the crush I had"
on the kid in my class who was a demon?
There is no such thing as demons.
Grrr!
"Tohru, remember?"
Your favorite--
grape soda.
Grape what?
Ooooh!
(Growls)
Uhh!
"Jade: Tohru, stop this!"
Why are you acting like you work for the dark hand?
Because I work for the dark hand.
Uncle: Then shame on you!
Just like old times.
Maybe that will knock some sense into him.
But how did it get knocked out of him in the first place?
He's how!
Valmont! - Valmont!
What have you done to tohru?
"Last I saw, he was rolling down a hill."
"Your doing, I believe."
"Tell us the truth, friar liar!"
Perhaps tohru had enough of sweeping floors
and decided to take a better offer.
Mine.
"Uncle: Sweeping floors may be dirty work,"
but it is honest!
Tohru is family.
He'd never join you again!
"Well, if you don't believe me..."
Why don't you just ask him?
(Tohru growls)
"Tohru, please."
"T, don't listen to valmont!"
Uncle: You will pay for this.
Aah! - Aah! - Aah!
Uhh! Unh!
"Dark hand 3, Jackie chan 0."
"Come, tohru."
"Yes, master."
Uncle: Ayah!
We are trapped!
And we've lost tohru.
For good.
(Jackie grunting)
Uhh!
It is no use.
"Well, if valmont can crawl out from under a rock,"
"to steal back tohru, we can, too."
"Steal him back, I mean, er, again."
Uncle: <i> Yu mo gue</i> <i>guai fi di ziao.</i>
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i> <i>fi di ziao.</i>
<i>Yu mo gue guai fi di zi--</i>
"uncle, you rock! Levitation spell?"
Uncle cannot pack spell ingredients for every occasion!
Sheesh! Who says mud baths are relaxing?
Did you see where tohru went?
Big fellow.
Monk: Aieee!
Master babur has lost his memory.
Who is babur?
See?
Whoa. This amnesia bug's really going around.
"Hotcha! If babur and tohru both have amnesia,"
valmont must have used a potion on them.
"And with that potion, uncle can devise antidote to bring back tohru's memory."
Valmont must still have it with him.
We just have to find him.
"Oh, there is no hope of that."
"The strangers have embarked for the temple of the golden elephant,"
and only master babur knows where it is.
Are you my mother?
"Oh, the temple's location is lost forever."
Oh? Can of grape soda tells uncle otherwise.
Valmont: Ahh.
The golden elephant lies within that temple.
Ow!
don't you recognize boiling water?
"Oh, now, how do we get across?"
A riddle?
Perhaps if we answer it...
"""What do you call the life story of a car?"""
"Uh, cartoon?"
Vehicular memoirs?
Jade: Duh!
Autobiography!
I was about to say that.
Toodle-oo!
Oopsy.
"Come on, come on!"
Aah!
Jackie! Water very hot!
I am not soup yet!
Jackie! Huhh!
Uhh!
And he spikes the landing!
How do we get across now?
Did you not pay attention?
Uncle: We must answer riddle.
No problemo.
"""What is the beginning of eternity..."
"""The end of time and space,"
"""the beginning of every end,"
"and the end of every place?"""
No fair! We got a brainbuster!
Valmont: At last.
My ticket - to a life of luxury!
"And so few have seen it, it will never be missed."
Jade: End of every place...
End of every place.
The exit?
I wish this was a lake of crosswords.
I am better at those.
Uncle: Eeeeeee!
Stub your toe?
The answer to the riddle.
The end of time and place.
"In English, it is the letter ""e."""
"Well, uncle."
Uhh!
Just lift with your legs and pack up that pachyderm!
"Yes, master."
Uhh!
Creepy.
Uhh!
Funny how the guy who can't remember
is trying to steal the animal that never forgets.
"Stop, tohru!"
"If you remove the elephant,"
something very bad will happen!
Which would be?
Do not recall.
"I'm expert in Chinese mythology, not Indian."
don't listen. Our enemies are just trying
to trick you again.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Unnnhh!
Uh-oh.
Now I remember.
Stone sentinels will destroy
whomever attempts to steal elephant.
I never touched it!
T!
Oooh!
Uncle! Your spell!
Do you not listen?
Uncle cannot make amnesia antidote
without amnesia potion!
The turn-stone-into-mud spell.
"Ah, that one uncle can do."
And while you work your magic...
I'll motion for some potion.
Ha! The artful bungler.
Hand it over!
Say pretty please!
"Jade, did you see where uncle put dried blowfish?"
Cannot complete spell without it.
(Sighs)
"Uncle, are you ok?"
Uncle! Uncle who?
"Oh, boy."
"Fare thee well, you old goat!"
"Ah, I am a goat."
"No! You're uncle,"
the only one who can bring back tohru!
Baa!
Ecch! You're disgusting!
The harder they are...
The bigger they break.
"Valmont: Many thanks for your help, chan."
A shame tohru must render you senseless
so we may get on with our crime unhindered.
"Uh, tohru, if you please."
No.
"What do you mean, no?"
You were not so loyal to your loyal henchman.
"Well, I--I was simply hoping to duck away"
and find a large mallet with which to assist.
Something inside tells me that Jackie is my friend.
And something inside tells me
that you are forgetting who is boss.
Hyaaah!
Bull's-eye!
Where am I?
The ballet.
You're doing a fabulous <i> swan lake.</i>
Valmont can pirouette all the way to prison.
Prison?
"You need not worry, tohru."
"Elephants may remember with their heads,"
but you remembered us with your heart.
"Jade: Uh, Jackie?"
Baa!
That's all he's gonna remember us with
if we don't figure out how to get uncle's memory back.
Ta-da! - Baa!
Then perhaps we should start doing some...
Research. Research.
"Hey, Jackie, what's your favorite food?"
Anything fast.
I really don't like to sit there.
"12 people sit there, they give you a soup."
You have to wait. 12 people all have a soup.
The soup already cold.
I like everything quick.
Done.
This is a little much.
"Here, here. Kudos to the j-team!"
"El toro fuerte, the masked wrestler."
"Tohru, sumo- extra-ordinaire."
"Viper, the former thief turned museum's best friend."
"And of course, the brains who put the ""j"" into j-team--"
"Jade, and her trusty sidekick Jackie."
Ahem. - Huh?
"I'm sorry, young lady,"
the kid's corner is right this way.
But I'm the fifth member of the j-team!
Who do think wrote your copy?
"Look, yade. Crayons!"
Grr!
"And it's Jade, paco."
"Of course, we are here to celebrate the j-team"
and the stolen artifacts they recovered.
"So without further ado,"
our newly reinstated collection of Jade!
(All gasp)
But where's the yade?
It's been jacked. Duh!
And it's Jade.
Who wants to bet this is the work of the creep
who stole the Jade in the first place?
Seor Chang?
Not likely.
Chang's been doing hard time in the federal pen
since you all put him there.
"Well, if not captain hook, who?"
The museum's surveillance footage is about to tell us.
(Camera shutter clicks)
(Click)
(All gasp)
"So, uh..."
Who's the babe?
"Really, I appreciate you guys giving me the benefit of the doubt."
"I'm sorry, viper."
You know I have no choice.
Tch. Hello?
"Viper's a former thief,"
"accent on ""former."""
I have to admit
we have been through too much with viper.
I cannot believe she would resort to her old ways.
But the tape--
viper's face--
let me assure you:
My agents will be on this 24/7
until we uncover the truth.
"Well, what are we waiting for, team?"
Let's get the vipester off the hook.
"Jade, what are we looking for?"
"A crumb, a follicle, an eyelash,"
any little thing that'll prove viper's been framed
for swiping the Jade.
Why was this Jade not stolen?
Because it would take a man of my strength to lift it.
Then did miss viper steal just the hand?
It was the only piece of the collection
we were not able to recover.
"Because it's still attached to old Chang's elbow, paco."
Hmm.
A fine example of pre-aztec <i> lucha libre.</i>
(Alarm blares)
All: El toro?!
What has gotten into you?
"Hold this, <i>por favor.</i> Uhh!"
You are in cahoots with viper? Unh!
Not the stairs!
Uhh--uhh--uhh...
Uhh! (Crash)
(Growls)
(Gasps)
El toro?
A criminal?
Tch. Think again.
Uhh!
"El toro, what are you doing?"
The fuerte fandango.
Uhh!
Huuup!
I smell a rat in bull's clothing.
El toro fuerte never removes his mask.
Eww!
Whoa!
Uhh!
"If he is a phony,"
where is the real El toro?
(Muffled)
Huh?
"Oh, boy."
So soon?
So that's why you never remove your mask.
"Just fooling, handsome."
A frame-up seems to be the most logical explanation.
Why else go to the trouble of creating such perfect imposters?
Even I could not tell the difference.
Do you know what this means?
If there's a villain out there
"who recognizes us as a team,"
then we're big time!
"Considering the evidence acquitting viper,"
I've decided to bring Chang in
for questioning after all.
He's the only one with a motive.
"And what about the...Uh, mask?"
(Sighs) <i> Nada.</i>
The lab says its constituent parts
aren't based in any science we know.
Then maybe it's time to bring in...
The man from uncle.
Aiyaaa!
"Uncle, I'm glad you--"
what could be so important
that you drag uncle out of mah-jongg tournament?!
I will pin all of you to the mat.
"With what arms, El fake-o?"
We need your expert advice--
aiyaaa!
Why did you not drag uncle from tournament earlier?
This mask is clearly a product of dark forces.
"Really, captain black."
You pull me out of prison to accuse me
of orchestrating a plan from inside prison
that I couldn't possibly do unless I was outside prison?
I'll ask the questions here.
"What's the deal, Chang?"
How are you pulling it off?
"Come now, captain."
As much as I would enjoy having revenge on the j-team
"for retrieving the precious Jade I worked so hard to steal,"
you know my every move is monitored.
I'm sure your people are even aware of the flavor of my chewing gum.
"What? - Spearmint, Jackie."
No! His hand!
He has 2!
What are you talking about?
Chang has 2 hands
because that is not really Chang.
It is his magical duplicate.
You mean we're dealing with clones?
Aiyaa!
Who said anything about clowns?
We are facing forces more powerful than the circus!
I regret to inform you
"that your clone counterpart has been discovered, sir."
Then it is time to proceed to phase 2.
"Is the next clone ready, yip?"
Hmm. And in position
outside section 13.
"Chang: Then one by one,"
the j-team will be replaced
and eliminated.
"So, are we off to the top-secret meeting about the clones?"
"Jade, the meeting is for team members only."
Right. Race ya there.
"Hey, think I have a clone?"
Duh!
Of course I do.
It's the only surefire way
for them to take out the brains of the team.
Just what I need--
another Jade.
Bwaa!
Oh.
I must have clones on the brain.
Hmm.
Was there always a mirror here?
Ha.
Uhh.
Blablabalbalabla.
"Oh, silly me."
"Hey, Jackie. Hello."
Oh! Ugh!
(Groans)
Daaahhh!
Going down?
(Blows)
Daaahhhh!
Do not worry.
You will not be missed.
Duplicates are imperfect.
"They contain flaws like Chang's extra hand,"
but each is more powerful
"than its human counterpart,"
due to its magic.
"Oh, we can take 'em, unc."
We'll face off in an epic battle royale.
"Human versus clone,"
"good versus evil,"
Jade versus Jade.
You miss uncle's point!
Magic must defeat magic.
Look who decided to show.
Heh. Sorry I'm late.
"Hmm, now one more thing."
We must be very watchful
for these defective duplicates.
(Breathes rapidly)
Uncle!
We must watch out for--
it is Jackie's clone!
Huh? No! Wait!
Ohh!
I am me!
He is not me!
"Tricky clone, isn't he?"
Which is the real Jackie chan?
I have a little quiz only the real Jackie could answer.
"Jackie, when is my birthday?"
"Oh, uh... - Oh, uh..."
"Gee, Jackie. I thought we were pretty good friends."
"Ahem. Hey, Jackie."
Will you take me to moose world this weekend?
Of course. - Not!
You have homework.
There's your clone.
I'm sorry. I'll be back to destroy you later. Thank you!
Not to worry.
Jackie's clone will lead us right to Chang himself.
"You see, I planted a little tracking device on his..."
Collar.
"Cheer up, chief."
I managed to place a tracker on the clone.
(Clears throat)
"Then let's move out, team."
No one is moving out!
There may yet be a clone among us.
"A bit excessive, don't you think?"
Do you want duplicate to attack uncle when it is discovered?
No? Then sit quietly.
"Uh, viper, did you always have that mole?"
"Hey, if you want to start--"
let us not accuse one another.
Any one of us might be a clone--
"eh, except for me."
Hey!
Doesn't anyone think I might be a clone?
All: No.
I'm not feeling the love here.
"If a duplicate is among us,"
fish will glow.
(Chanting)
"If I were a clone, would I know it?"
Tohru is the only j-team clone we have not encountered.
Then I am a clone.
(Sobs) I am so sorry.
Fish does not lie.
"Ah, thank you, fish."
<i>Excellente!</i>
"(Without accent) They are not clones, Jade!"
"Um, what did you call me?"
"Your name, of course. Jade."
That's what I thought.
Let me see that.
(All gasp)
"Paco has a clone, and I don't?"
Way unfair!
We are - in great danger.
"Paco, please. Say it is not so."
"But it is,"
and now I will destroy you all.
Mwa ha ha ha ha!
Ungh!
"Uh, I'll be just a moment."
Ungh!
"Unh, almost got it."
"Uncle, how do you stop it?"
Uncle has not yet researched that part!
"But, El toro, you cannot harm me."
You are the greatest.
I cannot.
(Grunts) How about now?
(Gasps)
Whaaaaa!
Unh!
(Grumbles)
"Uh, someone want to help me with this?"
Is that the best you have?
"If this thing is a clone,"
then where is the real paco?
"El toro, where are you?"
Looks like Chang's returned to his old stomping grounds.
If seor Chang has harmed one hair on paco's head...
He is big.
"Jade clone, 10 o'clock."
Where?
Oh. You mean me.
"Jade, we left you at section 13 for a reason."
How did you find us here?
Tracking device.
(Grumbles) Tracking device.
Look!
Paquito.
How do we get past them?
Duh.
You think they can tell we're not clones?
Remember!
Think like a clone.
(Robotic) I am tohru's clone.
Are you all right?
"Uh, fine. You?"
Master Chang requires your presence.
We'll guard the hostage.
My brave <i> hombre.</i>
"Jade, can you believe even I have a clone?"
Ha ha. Yeah. Pretty awesome.
How convenient.
"The entire j-team in one spot,"
which ought to facilitate your group demise
rather nicely.
"How did you do it, Chang?"
Magic was never your m.O.
All it takes is a little collaboration
with a master of the dark arts
and a grudge.
Clones!
Where's mine?
"Ok, team. Let's rock!"
What's the kid doing here?
(Sighs) She never listens.
"Ok, team. What my clone said."
Grrr!
"Hold it, big fella. It's me."
"Oh, sorry."
Gotcha. Hee-yah!
Hi-yah! Oof!
Got you.
Wedginator!
Eep!
Raaah!
El toro: Grrrr!
Vaaah!
Aah!
Oof!
Wrong one!
Sorry.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Jackie, I have devised way to defeat clones."
Let me speak to my apprentice.
"Uh, it is for tohru."
This is tohru.
"Tohru, like the originals,"
the duplicates are naturally good.
An additional spell was required to make them evil.
On an interesting side note--
"very compelling, but--"
ooh!
Uncle: ...Which is why your mother has terrible manners.
"Sensei, please. The spell."
Uncle is getting to that!
Maybe you didn't know
I'm a master of the ancient art of butt whup.
Chi-yah!
Ha! Chi-yah!
Ha!
Whoa--ohh.
Maybe you didn't know the original
is always better than a copy.
Ohh.
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"Ok, got it."
(Chanting)
"All is quiet, sir."
Then the j-team is no more?
My clones are far more powerful
than their human counterparts.
Huh? - Huh?
"Jade and Jade clone: Let's rock, team--wha!"
"Jackie and Jackie clone: Jade, leave this to the grownups."
Ohh! - Ohh!
"The j-team has done it again, Jade."
"Both: Teams, paco. The j-teams,"
and it's Jade.
Unh.
Just what I need.
Another j-team.
"Hey, Jackie."
Are you afraid of the dark?
Yes and no.
"Sometimes when I'm walking in a very dark, dark place,"
there's somebody-- just tell me the ghost story.
"As long as I'm not doing bad things,"
always helping people--
"wherever I go, I don't scare dark anymore."
My tattoo just has to be gnarly.
This is a symbol of great evil.
Awaken from shadow! Serve your new master!
Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!
Prepare for battle!
Wow! We rock!
Uhh! Uhh!
Yah! Ooh! Uhh!
(Gasps)
Busted.
(Jade sighs)
Dullsville.
No. The capital of Georgia is Atlanta.
"Jade, your geography test is tomorrow."
Let's try Oregon.
Why does tohru get to study the fun stuff?
Uncle is waiting.
I know this one.
"That is a symbol for a conjuring spell,"
one which requires garlic and...Ginger?
Correct... If you are making chicken chow mein!
"Do you plan on becoming chi wizard, tohru?"
Then you must prepare for day
when new evil enters our world.
<i>Bon appetit.</i>
Want gruel with that?
Today's special.
"Hey, how's that special sauce coming?"
(Chanting)
"This had better work, ""wizard."""
While I no longer possess my full powers...
"I, daolon wong, have amassed the spell ingredients"
required to make our escape.
(Chanting becomes feverish)
Come to me. Yes!
"Liberate us, shadowkhan!"
"Rise, my army of darkness!"
Tarakudo: Your army?!
Huh? Huh? Huh?
I am the one and only king of the shadowkhan!
I am the one and only king of the shadowkhan!
Tarakudo? Awakened?
"And ready to reclaim my ninja magic,"
"a task for which I will require ""assistance."""
Ratso: Uh...
Finn: We have to go check on dessert now.
(Roars) Aah!
Yahh! Uhh!
(Escape sirens)
"Jackie, the dark hand thugs have escaped from prison."
(Gasps) Daolon wong!
"Good news is, the ""wizard"" is still in custody."
(Cell phone rings)
Black.
Miller airfield?
Send in every available agent.
Huh?
Your assistance will not be necessary!
Magic will defeat magic!
Good-bye.
Uncle: Daolon wong or no daolon wong...
"A new, greater evil has forced its way into our realm!"
"When we find dark hand thugs, we will find this evil."
Hurry!
Yes!
"50 states, 50 capitals."
Uhh!
"Serve me well, and your reward will be great."
Yeah...About that.
"We appreciate you busting us out and all, tarakudo-San,"
"but the truth is, we're kinda burnt out"
on the whole - henchman-for-hire thing.
"Ah! You require motivation, then."
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Ok.
When do we start?
Ready to work!
Phew! (Sighs of relief)
That's the spirit!
"Now, where is this ""dark hand jet""?"
Visitors?
Jackie chan and friends!
He's always gettin' in our way.
So now would be an excellent time to bring on the ninjas!
Not just yet. Ready the plane.
(Roars)
(Gasps) <i> Oni.</i>
(Gasps)
"Uh, ""new evil,"" right?"
The symbol of the shadowkhan!
"What fun is a ""symbol"" without drums?!"
"Tohru! Come on, big fella."
Trying to save you a nasty bruise here.
Uhh!
(Gasps)
Captain black!
(Moans)
Uncle: Jackie! Quickly! Floating head!
Aah! Dahh! Ooh!
Ehh!
"Hey, Jackie."
Bwaaa!
"Before you get mad, listen."
The capital of Kansas is Kansas City.
"The capital is Topeka, and that is not the point!"
Uh-oh.
Whoa.
<i>You.</i>
"Ah! The former ""queen of the shadowkhan."""
Returning to the forces of darkness?
"Thank you, no. Not today!"
Er--what Jackie said.
In time. You're young.
Find cover.
Enforcers: Come on!
The spells are not working!
Aah! Aah!
That is because you do not study hard enough!
Hmm. Spell work after all.
No. Something tells me big head got on the plane.
Black: Jackie!
"You want a barf bag, chan?"
'Cause you're about to experience some air sickness.
Aah! Whoa!
Buh-bye.
Aah!
"Bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"It's Jackie, and he doesn't appear to have a parachute."
"Tohru, catch Jackie!"
Uh...
"Happy trails, chan."
Huh?
(Yells)
Jackie would <i> so</i> not approve.
Aah--aah--aah-- aah--aah--aah-- aah--aah--aah!
"Hey, Jackie!"
Bwaaa! Jade!
Never exit an aircraft without one of these!
"Good catch, tohru."
Quickly now! We must follow floating head!
(Groans)
(Grunts)
Mommy!
(Panting)
Tohru? Tohru?
Heh! Bad dream.
Lemme guess. Mr. creepy head?
"Jade, you are supposed to be with captain black."
Thought I should be here in case you fall from another plane.
The head. It reminded me of the oni.
The who-ni?
"When I was a child growing up in Japan,"
my mother told me tales of the oni--
"hideous, horned demons"
who would sneak into the rooms of disobedient children.
And what did they want with these disobedient children?
The oni would--(Gulps)-- Eat their souls! Eww!
So these oni are like Japanese bogeymen.
Pfft! Fairy tales!
"Floating head cannot be ""oni."""
It can't?
Of course not!
Everyone who has controlled the shadowkhan has been <i> Chinese!</i>
"Shendu, Chinese! Daolon wong, Chinese!"
But oni are <i> Japanese!</i>
(Beep)
Radar indicates the dark hand jet has landed in Hong Kong.
See? Hong Kong! Chinese!
Jackie: Shendu's palace?
Shendu collected many artifacts possessing great magic.
Floating head may be seeking one of these.
Check it out! Rabbit hole!
Uh...I will stand guard outside.
"don't be afraid, t."
It's just a silly old head.
(Gulps)
"Just a silly old soul-stealing,"
shadowkhan-controlling head.
Tarakudo: Ahh! Consider it a gift.
"Oh, just like Christmas!"
Bet there's a ton of treasure in it!
"Dude, you brought us all this way for a mask?"
"It was from this ""mask"" that shendu drew the power"
to control his shadowkhan army
and through which daolon wong's magic
channeled - that very same power.
Why don't you see how it fits?
(Gasps) Jackie!
I know.
Yes!
Peek-a-boo!
Seagull shucks oyster!
Aah! (Grunts)
(Growls)
Aah! Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh! Ooh!
Again?!
Who <i> are</i> these people?
"Well, Jackie chan's some kind of do-gooder,"
"and the big guy over there used to be one of us,"
"but now he's on their side,"
and the old guy pointing the blowfish--uhh!
Who else wants a piece of uncle?!
You have no idea who you are dealing with.
Enlighten me.
"Bow before tarakudo, king of all shadowkhan,"
lord of all oni!
(Gasps) So you <i> are</i> Japanese!
Uhh!
Consider yourself enlightened.
Tohru!
Uhh!
Huh?
Tarakudo: Mind over matter!
Mine! Not so fast!
Hey!
What's going on?!
Grr! I wanted that!
"Handsome devil, isn't he?"
Chow here will stick around and familiarize himself with his new powers
while we make further preparations.
Aah! Uhh! Aah!
"What does he mean by ""further preparations""?"
(Grunts)
Aah!
"Four against one. Now, that hardly seems fair."
(Roars)
Uh...Jackie?
I'm getting the feeling
this masked thing gives chow the power to summon...
Shadowkhan.
(Efforting)
Uhh!
Boo!
"Face your fear, t!"
(Growls)
Uhh!
Light as a feather!
Waaah--uhh!
Uhh!
Aiyaaa!
We must remove demon mask from host
in order to defeat shadowkhan!
"Jackie, one more thing!"
"Keep shadowkhan busy, so uncle can cast proper spell!"
"I am trying, uncle. Aah!"
"What spell would that be, sensei?"
"(""I don't know"" sound)"
"Hey, lookee here."
Maybe this picture book can help.
Catch me if you can!
Chan hunt!
"What do the inscriptions say, unc?"
"These are <i> Japanese,</i> kanji. Uncle only reads <i> Chinese.</i>"
"Uh, I read Japanese... But it has been many years."
"In fact, I am probably too shaky,"
so forget that I mentioned--
"tohru, read kanji now!"
"Yes, sensei."
Uhh!
Aah!
(Efforting)
The kanji tell of ancient warriors
"who once cast a spell to defeat this oni,"
trapping its spirit within the mask.
The key ingredient was Japanese steel...
Specially forged for a samurai sword.
Aiyaa! We will not find steel of samurai sword here
because shendu is not Japanese!
Hmm.
Bwaaa!
"Well, it doesn't say ""made in Taiwan."""
"Smackdown time, chan!"
Waaah! Daaah!
Uhh!
Uhh! Daaah!
"You've been working out, chow!"
"Jade, what makes you certain this is Japanese steel?"
Uh...I'm not.
Haaah! Daaah!
Diiih! Ohh!
Daaah! Ohh!
Uhh! Ohh!
"It's over, chan."
(Tohru and uncle chat)
Yes. It is.
(Chant finishes)
"Jackie, remove mask!"
Uhh! Get him off me!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Aah!
Ohh!
Aah! Aah!
Why isn't it coming off?
Patience!
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Destroy him!
"""Boo."""
Aah!
Perhaps this would be safer in the vault at section 13.
New evil has been defeated.
Um...One more thing.
"Oh, no."
Guys?
Guys?!
"Hey, guess this means I'm finally a free henchman. Heh heh!"
Aah!
(Pants) don't do that!
You have failed me.
Do not fret. It is but a minor defeat.
That's cool.
Tarakudo's an ok guy.
"Besides, our mission has only yet begun."
Uh...
It has?
It goes on to say...
That tarakudo once terrorized the land with his trusted oni generals.
Each demon general controlled its own army
which were comprised of a different tribe of shadowkhan.
"Uh, different how?"
I would prefer not to have to find out.
Tohru: Tarakudo's reign came to an end
when the spirits of his generals were trapped within masks.
"9 generals, 9 masks."
"9 ""different"" tribes of shadowkhan?"
What are we waiting for?
There are 8 more masks which we must find
before forces of darkness do!
Let me guess.
The masks were scattered across the earth?
"Yep. Uh, one more thing."
"Should the 9 masks ever be revived,"
their combined power may summon enough shadowkhan
to engulf the entire earth in eternal darkness.
Aiyaa! Tohru must do research!
He must?
You were told childhood tales of oni by mother.
You read Japanese.
"You <i> are</i> Japanese, so <i> you</i> must do research!"
(Gulps)
"Yes, sensei."
"Yes! New adventure, uh-huh! Find the masks, be the shadowkhan..."
Hey Jackie do you ever get tired of traveling all over the world?
"Yeah, I do get tired of traveling around the world."
"I've been-- the last 20 years,"
"I've been travel, travel, travel."
"One day I want to settle down,"
"have my own studio,"
just shoot everything in the same place.
Then I don't have to travel anymore.
"But, put another way, travel is good."
I learn so many things--
"different cultures, different cities."
Everything's different.
Yeah. That's the good thing.
I am the one and only king of the shadowkhan.
(Gasps) Oni.
My mother told me tales of the oni--
hideous horned demons.
Tarakudo: It was from this mask
that shendu drew the power to control his shadowkhan army.
Tohru: Ancient warriors once cast a spell to defeat this oni.
The key ingredient was Japanese steel.
Tarakudo's reign came to an end
when the spirits of his generals were trapped within masks.
9 general...9 masks.
9 different tribes of shadowkhan?
Whoa.
"""Captain black,"
"""do not allow anyone to wear this mask."
Jackie: Please lock it in the vault immediately.
"Jade, uncle, tohru, and I are currently in Tokyo, Japan,"
where we hope to discover a lead
to the location of the next oni mask.
"Karaoke break, anyone?"
"Jade, the first rule of research is Patience."
"Uncle: Can you not read faster, tohru?"
Cobwebs are forming on uncle!
"My Japanese is rusty, sensei."
"Hmmhh! At this rate, new forces of darkness"
will locate 8 other masks before we leave room!
(Jade shouts)
Jade!
Why do research
when you can come on down to
the oni mask superstore!
Oni!
"Until a cursed one is worn,"
these are merely masks.
"Then why do I have a strange,"
clammy feeling down my spine?
<i>You...</i>
Have the willies?
Usually a pretty good sign
that the king of all oni is in the house!
Tarakudo! - Tarakudo!
(Shuddering) Ohhh!
Henchmen!
"Lend a hand, won't you, and fetch the mask."
Ratso: Uh...
Which mask?
The magic one!
No! Stop!
Nope. - Nope.
No. - That's not it.
Nuh-uh. Ho ho.
Nah. Nope. That's not it.
Nope. Nope.
Jade: Hands off!
"Quickly, tohru!"
We most devise locator spell
so we may find mask before they do!
Back! Back!
Easy. You could chop someone's head off with that.
What are you doing?!
Uh...Lookin' for the mask?
Try <i> this</i> fellow.
Hak foo: Kangaroo hop!
Nice grab.
Ratso: Gotcha!
Huh?
Heee-yah!
Ratso: Ooh!
Oopsy.
(Groaning)
Ohhh...
Whoa.
"Oh, <i> I</i> wanted that mask!"
Ow!
Too late for locator spell.
We need mask removal spell.
Good thing Japanese steel ingredient
very handy this time.
"Oh, man! I feel like..."
Summoning shadowkhan?
Yeahhhh!
"So...Do I just yell for 'em, or what?"
"You must feel the power, ratso."
Call upon the darkness within.
"Oh, ok. I got it."
Uhh! No! No feeling! No calling!
Gohh--uhh!
"Come on, shadowkhan!"
(Gasps)
Unhh!
Whoa!
Sweet.
"Go, ratso!"
9 masks...
9 different tribes of shadowkhan.
"Uncle, how is"
your mask removal spell coming?
All done.
Aiiyee!
"The sword did not work, sensei."
It must be wrong ingredient.
Each mask must require a unique removal spell!
Which do we need to remove <i> this</i> mask?
You are Japanese expert! That is <i> your</i> department!
Ahem.
Oh. Right.
Make papa proud!
"You hit him high, Jackie, I'll hit him low."
Awpp!
D-uhh!
Uhh!
Uhhh! Uhh...?
Uhh!
Aah!
Come. Let us seek more masks
while ratso summons
more shadowkhan.
Hah hah hah hah!
"The more, the scarier."
Urrrhhh!
D-eeeee!
"Uncle: Oh, Mr. ninja!"
Eat chi magic!
Uncle's regular magic
does not work on these new shadowkhan!
We must devise new stun spell.
Uhh! Euhh! Uhh!
(Metal clang)
Heh. Sayonara.
Jackie! Sensei! Run!
"Come on, come on, come on!"
Ooowahh!
Darkness within.
Darkness within.
Darkness within.
Unhh! - Uhh! - Uhh!
Ohhhhh...
Boy...
Yes! I am good!
Get chan!
Huh?
Ohh... Grab on!
D-uhhh...
Yaahhh! Aaahhh!
Tohru: Aaahhh...Uhh!
P-uhhh.
I hate fish.
Ratso: Hey!
Where'd everybody go?
"Tarakudo: A job well done, boys."
For our next trick... Whoo-o-o-o!
Whoa. Are you all right?
"What is it, big kahuna?"
I think I...
Have the willies.
Sensei...
The scroll speaks
of the legendary Hana-fuda...
An ancient deck of cards.
My mommy told me of these cards when I was young.
Phewww! More fairy tales.
Cards not important!
But legend indicates that the cards are magic...
And may point the way to the remaining oni masks.
"I am telling you, cards not important!"
Tohru?
Let me guess. Your old pal Willie?
So...
Hoping to find the Hana-fuda cards?
"Well, I can't let you do that!"
Ok...
Maybe cards important.
Back!
Onion?
"Do not be foolish, tohru."
Use garlic.
"Whoa! Easy with that veggie, big fella."
Aaahh! My eyes!
It <i> does</i> work!
I think it is checkout time.
Rahhhhhh!
Mommy always told me onions keep the oni away.
I used to sleep with one under my pillow.
"You da man, t! You da man!"
Yes...He is.
The best thing
about makin' your own team of ninjas?
Is makin' enough for 2 teams!
"Ratso: Ooh, high fly!"
"If <i> I</i> wore the mask,"
all of Japan would be under my rule by now!
"Oh, ball boy..."
Ohhh...Get it yourself.
You don't want to spoil our fun...
"Do you, hak foo?"
Tarakudo: Ratso!
Gather your shadow minions.
You must see to it Mr. chan fails
to acquire a certain... Deck of cards.
Let the games begin.
We must take the train to matsue.
The Hana-fuda cards are housed
in an ancient shrine there.
Legend indicates that the cards contain the spells
which originally defeated the oni.
Handy-dandy mask removal action.
"Oh, uncle, that is not our train."
It is mine.
Uncle must go to airport now.
What?
Why?
Bein' away from shop for so long
makes me...Nervous?
Uncle...
(Sighs)
I am only getting in your way.
Tohru has knowledge of Japanese legends...
Which uncle does not.
"Tohru gets willies from oni,"
which uncle does not.
"Tohru knows tricks with vegetables,"
which uncle...
I require your guidance.
I offer you my confidence.
"Jade, go with uncle."
Ohhh...
Jade: I miss him already.
"Jade! I told you to go with uncle,"
not stay with...Uncle.
Tch! No wonder I got confused.
Too many uncles.
Ratso: All aboard...
The shadowkhan express!
"Gonna make you cry, demon boy."
(Munching)
"Mmm, mmm. Yummy."
"Uh, ratso is still part human,"
and his human side likes onions?
Quick! Inside!
"Darkness within, darkness within,"
"darkness within, darkness within..."
You have a train to catch!
Huhh! Uhh!
Unhh!
Heyyy-yuhh!
Uuurrrhhhh!
Uncle told me to devise a new stun spell...
So I did.
This is it.
That's a shrine?
"If it was, it is a factory now."
Wait.
This <i> kanji</i> meaning Hana-fuda...
Is also the factory logo.
Jackie: Hello!
Anybody here?
Oh. You do not work here.
"Uh, maybe you can help us, sir."
We are looking for some...Cards.
Hana-fuda cards?
Those would be the ones.
"Thus, the cards were handed down from my ancestors."
"As you can see,"
I based my company logo on the Hana-fuda <i> kanji.</i>
So...Why <i> are</i> you so interested
in my family's deck of cards?
Are you familiar with...Oni?
Of course. My grandmother would read me stories
when I was a child. Why?
Some very bad oni know of your cards.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
(Laughing) Oni are not real.
They are stuff of children's tales.
What is it?
The girl...
Her shadow.
Uh-oh.
Hiya.
Oni! (Sobbing) Ohhh!
Ohhhhh!
Take the cards! They are yours!
Hand them over!
Here you go.
"Oh, gee, thanks."
Hey!
Sorry I would not return them. Thank you.
Get those cards!
The old fake hand-off.
A mask removal spell is the only way
to stop ratso's shadowkhan for good.
They're all blank?
Did the scroll say anything about how to play?
No.
Then we need to figure out how to play...
Fast.
(Grunting and shouting)
Hmm.
Hooahh!
D-ohh!
D-ohhhh!
D-ohh.
Aaahh!
Bye-bye! Drive safely!
Uhhh!
D-oohh! D-oohh! Uhh! D-oohh!
Uh...Gin rummy?
How about...Crazy 8s?
Whoa! Look!
It's showing us the mask!
But we already know that part.
This one's telling us where to find--
"er, where we found it."
And...For a lifetime supply of grape soda...
The mask removal spell ingredient is...
Tohru: Japanese silk.
You mean like in a kimono?
Where can we find a kimono at this time of...
Game...Over.
Ohhhh!
"Leave him alone, you bully!"
Tohru didn't invite <i> me</i> to play cards.
You can play <i>my</i> favorite--
go fish.
Hel-lo.
Uncle!
Hmm.
Very good stun spell.
"Yeah? Well, I got more ninja bad boys"
where <i> they</i> came from. Mmhh!
Unhhh...Hhh!
D-ohh! - Ooh!
Uncle! You're back!
Only because I realized
I do not have keys to shop!
(Keys jingle)
Oops. (Chuckles embarrassedly
keys not important now!
Did you discover ingredient for mask removal spell?
Japanese silk?
Blended wool and polyester!
Uncle does not wear clothes
of movie star or male model!
Or...
President of car company?
Ruhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Ohh!
Uhh! Uhhhh!
Uhhh! - J-uhh!
(Chanting)
(Chanting)
Hey!
Urrrhhh!
Uhhh! Gahh!
G-uhh! G-uhh!
Ohhh! Gahh! G-uhh!
Uhhh...
Yes!
Ohhh...
(Stupidly) I was havin' the weirdest dream.
Waaahhh!
Yaaahhh!
Oh! Ooh! Ooh! My turn at bat!
"It would appear chan possesses the cards,"
since <i> you</i> no longer possess horns!
Ohhh...
Yeah.
(Chuckles embarrassedly)
Two down...
7 to go.
Well...Anyone up for some slapjack?
"Sensei, what will keep tarakudo"
from penetrating the vault?
Urrrrhhh!
Uhhh!
Ohhh...
Aahh!
My eyes!
My eyes!
Oni magic cannot defeat onion magic.
A little trick I learned
from my...
Apprentice.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, do you play baseball?"
Of course I like baseball. You know what?
I'm the honorable chairman baseball captain
in Hong Kong.
"Uh, I do play baseball,"
"but I'm--actually, I'm not really good,"
"because when I look at TV, it just easy."
"But you really try to hit it, it's difficult."
I love...Baseball.
"Jackie chan, it was nice knowing you."
Gorilla fist!
Horse kick!
Weasel strike!
Otter slap! Huh?
Perhaps you should save it
for the real Jackie chan.
"Towel off and grab your shoes, hak foo."
I have located the next oni mask.
"I shall wear it proudly, master tarakudo,"
"and with its magic,"
summon vast armies of shadowkhan!
"Oh, incidentally..."
Floating head annihilates punching bag!
Jackie! Scruffy hates puppy prison.
How long do we have to keep tormenting him this way?
"Jade, scruffy must attend obedience school"
until he learns to listen.
No doubt he takes after his master.
Har har.
"Look, I can prove scruffy obeys all my commands."
"You ready, boy? Play dead!"
Whoa!
"Heh! ""Dead"" needs work,"
"but he has the ""play"" part down."
"Uncle: It is your move, tohru."
Hmm. No.
Huh!
Who's winning?
"Jade, the Hana fuda cards are no game."
Huh! Huh!
We are attempting to make cards reveal
location of next oni mask
before forces of darkness find it.
(Scruffy sniffing)
"Aiya! No animals in shop! Shoo, shoo!"
"Uh, 52 pickup is no game?"
Whoa!
Ohh! It is the next mask we seek.
Jackie: And this card shows us where to find it.
Right here in San Francisco?
And it looks like the mask removal spell ingredient
is Japanese rice!
"Tohru, boil rice!"
"Jackie, find mask."
"Jade, read sign."
Sign?
The one in shop window.
No pets allowed!
(Banging on door)
Mordecai!
"Howdy, y'all."
Egbert!
Farmer MacDonald?
Did you not see sign in uncle's window?
"The one that says, ""stop on by"
"""if you're ever in this neck of the woods"
"for a big city tractor pull""?"
"Uh, farmer MacDonald,"
we were just in the middle of--
"well, deal us in!"
Mordecai and egbert haven't had
much real fun since y'all left my farm.
"If you ask me,"
they miss them crazy magic powers they had.
"You mean, heat-beam eyes and levitation?"
"Float like a butterfly,"
sting like a... Hot-eyed pig.
"Please, farmer MacDonald,"
Jade is very impressionable.
Jackie!
"Right, unc. Time to play find that mask."
"Say, y'all don't mind if we bunk here, do you?"
Aiya!
"Well, strap on my feed bag!"
What's for supper?
Uncle was thinking pork or chicken.
Oh! Heh heh heh!
"Jade, why don't you stay here"
and help uncle find farmer MacDonald and his friends
more...Appropriate lodgings.
Ohh!
(Growling)
Aah! Ohh!
Huh?
"Wrong museum, Jackie."
"The mask is Japanese, not Jurassic."
Jade! I thought I told you
to help farmer MacDonald find a place to stay.
Tsk! Did!
(Squawking) (Alarm)
"Hey, there he is! Hey, where's he going?"
"Hey, pig! Come here, pig!"
He's up there!
Fancy supersecret underground base
"you got here, captain."
So where do you keep the flying saucers?
Jade! Section 13 is not a hotel.
And ancient artifacts are not doggie treats!
"Scruffy, heel!"
"Heh! He thought I meant ""dinosaur heel."""
"Jade, the card is leading me to..."
Jackie...
Unh!
Ohh! The oni mask!
I always said scruffy was part bloodhound.
They didn't teach you that
"at obedience school, did they?"
"Did they, you good boy?"
"Jade, we had better leave before--"
grr! T-Rex decapitates dodo!
"Go, go, go!"
"Give me the mask, chan."
Uh-uh-uh!
Only if you promise never to wear it.
Then suffer extinction!
"Jackie, I'm open!"
"He so never obeys me, either."
"Tarakudo Rex,"
king of the shadowkhan!
"Jackie, heads up!"
Waah!
Lobster claw pinches mask!
"Hak foo, show me a face"
only a demon's mother could love.
At last! Unh!
Check it out! Scruffy's totally helping.
"No, he is totally playing!"
Ugg!
Unh!
Oof!
Hyah! - Argh!
"Jackie, go wide!"
Drat!
Nice catch!
That is not a frisbee!
Not exactly who I had in mind.
(Growls)
Um...Bad doggie?
Scruffy?
Tiger tears mask off pooch!
"Friendly reminder, <i>muscles,</i>"
the only thing that can separate
a mask from its wearer is--
blecch--good magic.
Now go enjoy a protein shake.
Waah!
"Here, boy!"
Jade! Scruffy could be dangerous.
Tsk! My dog loves me.
"don't you, scruffy-wuffy?"
Huh?
Scruffy!
"Oh, no."
Aah! - Jackie!
"Scruffy, stay! Please?"
Jackie!
Seems it's time to walk the dog.
(Jackie groans)
"Jackie, are you all right?"
(Moans) No broken bones.
Come on! We have to find scruffy.
Before tarakudo teaches him any new tricks.
Both: Like summoning shadowkhan!
"Chan to section 13,"
requesting transport for Jade.
What?!
But...My dog!
I'm sure egbert and mordecai
just loped on down
to that silo you mentioned for some grub.
"It's a missile silo, not a grain silo."
"Scruffy's all mondo-megamonster-powered,"
which means Jackie's gonna need help.
Superhelp.
Farmer Mac did say you guys miss the magic.
Levitation!
Heat-beam eyes!
Motion for a motionless moose!
Duh-huh!
And superstrength for t-girl!
Whoa.
Talismans.
They do a body good.
"Scruffy! Here, boy!"
(Whistles)
Wha?! Eww!
Huh! Pee-yuu!
That is the largest poopie I have ever--
I must be on the right track.
"Well, doggie park certainly has been invigorating."
But it's time you answered
a different call of nature.
(Howls)
(Gasps)
"Scruffy, no! Stop!"
Scruffy?
don't you think he looks more like a spike?
"Spike, unleash your pack!"
"Supermoose, humming <i> charge:</i> ¶ doodle-la doo-do-doo ¶"
"hang on, Jackie!"
Say hello to t-girl and her amazing t-troop!
The animals! Your moose!
Your muscles.
Heh heh. Joined a...Gym?
"This is your team, Mr. chan?"
"A child, a ham, a stuffed moose?"
Ha ha ha!
And a flying chicken?
"That's levitating rooster to you, fat-head!"
(Howls)
"Take 'em, t-troop!"
¶ Doodle-la doo-do-doo ¶
antler action!
"I got your back, Jackie."
Titanic t-slam!
Whoa!
I so totally don't know my own strength.
Jade!
Uh-huh! Who da moose?! Me da moose!
You da chicken!
"Reinforcements, spike!"
"His name's scruffy, you no-necked demon!"
And he obeys me!
Oh?
"Here, boy! (Whistles)"
"Here, boy!"
(Howls)
(Sighs)
¶ Doodle-la doo-do-doo ¶
bad dog!
And growing worse.
"Soon the mask will take hold completely,"
making doggie a demon forever.
Not if I pull it off him.
don't you listen?
Even your biceps don't possess enough strength
to remove a demon mask from its wearer.
Duh.
That's why I swung by uncle's
for a little rice potion.
(Gasps)
Good magic!
Huh? Hey!
Give it back!
Whoa!
(All groaning)
"Playtime is over, child."
Spike!
Jade!
(Pig snorting)
What?! Timmy's trapped at the bottom of a well?
Help! Please! Pull me out!
I must rescue Jade!
Shh!
You don't wanna reveal t-girl's
"secret identity, do ya?"
T-girl? I--
I am debating with a stuffed moose.
T-troop away!
Whoa!
I just hope your barnyard buddies
haven't wandered into any highly sensitive
off-limits quarantined areas.
"Well, instead of frettin',"
why not try cluckin'?
And a-soowee-in'?
"Uh, come again?"
"Talk to the animals, son!"
Works like a charm.
(Quietly) Soo-wee.
Come on! Sound off like you mean it!
Be the hog!
"Relax, missy."
Strength is no match for the power of shadow.
(Grunts)
"I want my dog back, tarakudo!"
There they are.
We must retrieve uncle's mask removal potion.
"Scruffy, help me out, boy!"
Scruffy can't hear you.
"His transformation is nearly complete,"
which I shall demonstrate with a little obedience test.
"Spike, be a good demon,"
and make a meal of your former master.
"Not gonna happen, taradoo-doo."
Dogs never turn on their masters!
(Gulps) Do they?
"Good work, egbert!"
Now I am complimenting a rooster.
"Scruffy, don't you remember me?"
"I walked you, fed you!"
"Funny, you're about to feed him again."
Supermoose: ¶ doodle-la doo-do-doo ¶
t-troop is in the house!
Supertroopers!
Aah!
You people are giving me quite a headache!
Oh?
"Bring it on, my feathered foe."
¶ Doodle-la doo-do-doo ¶
ninja knockout!
Jackie: Sit! Heel! Stop!
Jade!
Hello?!
Secret identity!
"Scruffy, I'm gonna say it one more time."
Stay!
Aah!
"Ok, the kid gloves are off!"
"Welcome to obedience school, t-girl style!"
Stay!
"Anytime, Jackie!"
Your... Talisman magic...
Is no match for...Huh?
Shadowkhan!
Got it!
Scruffy! Good dog!
"I am a sore loser, t-girl."
Scruffy!
Oops.
Missed.
Scruff.
"He was a good dog, wasn't he, Jackie?"
A very good dog.
"Well, what do you know?"
He does play dead.
"Hopefully, farmer MacDonald isn't too worried"
about his missing animals.
(Everyone clucking and snorting like chickens and pigs)
Whoa!
What'd I tell ya?
Works like a charm.
"Hey, Jackie,"
"if you could be a dinosaur, which kind would you be?"
"If I were a dinosaur,"
"I would be a brontosaurus,"
"because big, but only eat vegetable."
Nobody can touch him.
Even the t-Rex.
"The t-Rex, too violent."
And...Yeah.
"I want to be a brontosaurus. Ah, difficult!"
Uncle: We will find next oni-mask
"in pacific northwest, near base of cascade mountains."
Why did I let you talk me into this?
"You said it yourself, Jackie, you're too fat."
I said I am too heavy to climb the totem pole
"without risk of damaging it, Jade."
"Heavy, fat--same diff."
Hey! He looks just like his mug shot.
He will fit snugly...
Upon my face!
Flying squirrel cracks acorn!
Unh!
Whoa!
Jade!
Aah!
Aaah!
Jade!
(Grunts)
Hang on!
(Growls)
You there! Chop chop!
Fetch the mask...
While I destroy chan. Hyah!
Yaah!
Unh!
Hunh! Flying dragon corkscrew!
(Grunting)
"Make it easy on yourself, kiddo."
We just want the mask.
Then come and get it. (Echoing)
"Tohru, is mask removal potion ready?"
"Uh, almost, sensei."
"So, what's the deal with these oni-masks anyway?"
You worry about driving. Let uncle worry about masks.
"Uh, sorry, dude."
"Uh, rocks crush paper."
Ohh!
Unh! (Growls)
Hunh!
Wait a minute! Paper covers rock.
(Grunts)
"End of the line, chans."
(Trees falling)
Aiyaa!
It...Jostled.
(Gasps) Ingredient for mask removal spell was very rare!
Ow!
Who told you to drive like hot shot?
"With no potion, we must ensure that no one wears mask."
Will do.
Hunh!
Hyah!
Oof!
Look out!
Captain black!
"I said look <i> out,</i> not up."
(Groaning)
Tiger snatches mask before it sticks!
"Guess again, kitty cat."
Huh?
(Grunting)
Captain black's got game.
Huh! - Hey!
Unh!
Exit's that way.
(Yelling)
Happy trails.
(Yelling)
"Captain black, are you...All right?"
Never better.
(Coughing and sputtering)
Finn: Tarakudo's gonna be one unhappy camper.
"Well, it ain't my fault. I was paper."
Ahem.
What is not your fault?
"We never had a chance, big head honcho, sir."
"That oni mask, it's defective."
"Yeah, captain black's wearing it,"
but he didn't go all dark side.
<i>The</i> captain black?
All: Uh-huh.
Then we now have a man on the inside.
Whoa! Captain black.
Your face...
Relax. It's only a mask.
Does it come off?
Why would I want it to?
(Grunting)
Whoa.
Jade: He's...Peppy.
But he does not seem evil.
Because captain black's inherent goodness is keeping
the dark forces within him at bay...
For the moment.
But we must remove the mask before it corrupts his chi.
"And to accomplish that, we must acquire more spell ingredient."
"Apologies, sensei."
One more thing!
"While tohru and I are away,"
it is essential that captain black
not learn the full extent of the mask's magic.
He must not summon his shadowkhan.
"So what are we supposed to do,"
distract captain hornhead with videos and board games?
(Alarm sounds)
Code blue.
3 dozen tourists have been abducted on Alcatraz.
"All right, let's go!"
Roger that!
"Take 5, boys."
I'll handle this one solo.
"Uh, maybe that is not such a good idea."
"What's wrong, Jackie?"
don't think ol' black magic is up to it?
(Grunting)
Help! Help us!
Help us!
Jade!
"You watch captain black's back, I watch yours."
Help us!
Help us! Help!
"Oh, captain black!"
We've never been formally introduced.
"I am tarakudo, king of all shadowkhan."
You may bow.
"The only king I bow to is Elvis,"
and I don't see you wearing blue suede shoes.
"And I don't see you wearing your mask at full throttle,"
and I can help you unleash its true potential.
"No sale, helium head."
"(Sighs) Oh, well. Plan b."
Ha! You'd better cook up plan c.
I already ate your goons for breakfast.
"He's being straight, t.K."
We can't beat him.
Wait for it...
(Grunting)
Now watch as the good captain
gets in touch with his dark side.
(Grunts) This is black! I need backup! Now!
Shadowkhan.
Big ones.
(Gasps)
I thought these guys were supposed to be on our side.
Eee-tai!
Aah!
Aaah!
Black here. Cancel that backup.
Whoa! Captain black has new recruits.
"Ahh, things are going exactly as I envisioned."
This is the plan?!
You have the right to remain busted!
"Jackie, why didn't you tell me I could summon these shadow guys?"
They're gnarly.
Heh heh. Must have slipped my mind.
(Gasping)
Ohh...
These midday swims are getting to be
"quite the habit with you, aren't they, hak foo?"
Uhh...Black has beaten us...Again!
"Calm down. By summoning his shadowkhan,"
black has sealed his promotion from captain
to demon general.
Where did all the agents go?
Black: Mandatory leave of absence.
"Meet the next generation of law enforcement, Jackie."
"Captain black, they are ninjas."
My ninjas...Obeying my every command.
"Loyal, efficient, tireless."
"Even as we speak, they're out there,"
cleansing the streets of scum.
He-hey! We got another one!
But I didn't do anything!
"I'm telling you, I'm innocent!"
"Yeah, yeah, save the drama for your mama."
"Good work, men!"
"Uh, what did all these people do?"
"It's what they <i> didn't</i> do, Jackie."
I'm sorry?
(Softly) They're not one of us.
(Softly) - How can you be sure?
(Whispers) The mask tells me.
It knows who's naughty and nice.
It tells me who to punish.
Where is uncle?
(Grunting)
Here is where we will find more rare seaweed
"for removal spell, tohru."
"Oh, I hate fish."
(Thump)
Aiyaa!
"If the oni-mask keeps ""talking"" to captain black,"
who knows what it will tell him next?
"If we keep him inside section 13 until uncle gets back,"
what's the worst that could happen?
(Gasps) The other oni masks!
We have to snag those face-huggers
before captain black remembers they're in the vault!
Jackie: Easier said than done.
Section 13 is crawling with his shadowkhan police.
We must act like nothing is wrong.
"Bad move, Jackie."
Gaah!
"Where you off to, <i> buddy?</i>"
Ha ha! Captain black! Just out for a stroll.
Hmm. Like to... The vault?
"Uh, no."
"Jackie, Jackie, Jackie."
I thought I could trust you.
I thought we were friends.
We are friends. That is why you must listen to me.
The mask is turning you into one of tarakudo's generals!
You must resist it!
Nonsense.
The mask lets me see things clearly.
Like the fact that you want to betray me.
"And since you're not one of us, Jackie,"
you can join the others.
Please! Listen to me!
Not to the mask!
(Electronic beeps)
Hmm?
"Come on, come on! Unh!"
(Grunts)
"Oh, Jade! don't go and make captain black mad!"
"""Black."" A fine name. The color of darkness."
(Grunts) Denied!
(Growls) No!
"Duh, Jade, they're shadows."
"You weren't planning on stealing my masks,"
"now, were you, Jade?"
"You're getting kind of greedy, aren't you, captain black?"
You only have one face.
"But 3 partners in darkness, itching for a makeover."
The captain black I know would never do that!
The captain black you know is on permanent vacation.
"Well, he's about to catch the next flight back!"
Unh!
Ohh. Haven't been feeling quite myself.
"Your other self isn't quite yourself, either."
"Whoa, Nelly!"
So you've gone and yanked my yin from my Yang.
Feels like a burden's been lifted.
Now what?
Hello?!
(Crash)
Hey! The power of an ox in my pinkie!
"Jackie's behind bars and uncle's m.I.A.,"
so it's up to us!
Let's go kick my butt!
"What's the matter, chan?"
don't you like your room?
Heh heh heh heh. Maybe you should complain to the management.
"Boys, I come bearing gifts."
No! Unh! Uhh! Uhh!
Put on a happy face.
Huh? - Huh? - Huh?
Rahr!
You've been jacked...
By the rabbit.
Catch her!
If you can!
Huh?
Uhh!
Rrr...
Facial!
Rrr...Rrr...
Tiger talisman?
Brought out the best in me.
Ohh.
They keys!
(Grunting)
Rrr!
The bigger they are...
The slower they are.
Hyuh! Uhh!
Uhh!
(Gulps)
Rrr...Uhh!
Ha ha ha!
I'm as strong as any one of you bruisers.
Ooh!
Uhh!
"Evil captain black: Oh, captain black..."
I don't think section 13 is big enough for the both of us.
Then I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
"Hurry, uncle."
"Quickly, tohru!"
(Grunting)
Eee!
Tohru: Aah! - Uncle: Aiyaa!
Uhh!
"Warning-- I may look small,"
but I'm a giant can of butt whoop
just waiting to be opened.
Weakling.
(Pow)
Ohh...
I'm embarrassed that we're even related.
"Ah, my masks."
Psst!
Jackie!
I told you--do not allow captain black
to summon shadowkhan!
"Captain black doesn't live here anymore, <i> old man.</i>"
"Guess again, sparky."
Give up yet?
Uhh!
Thought so.
"Look, I know we've been at each other's throats,"
but...Friends?
No agents.
Security here stinks.
Heh heh heh heh.
"Jade, you may want to add this to your collection."
"It's good to have you back, captain black."
It's good to be good.
Uncle: One more thing!
We must find phone booth removal potion!
"Hey, Jackie, have you ever had a disagreement with a good friend?"
"There's so many, - so many times that happened."
"Either one, you have to call,"
"""hey, are you angry about me?"""
"If I do something wrong, I say, ""sorry."""
"Because very hard to make a friend, a good friend."
"When you have a good friend, I would never let go."
"Besides, parents important, friends also important."
"All those years, I travelled so many places,"
the friends helped me.
"So friendship, friendship is very, very important."
Huh?
Oni!
This antique looks valuable.
Today is my lucky day.
Not!
No!
"Demon magic, here I come."
Finn: Not!
You clowns had your shot at being ninja masters
and you blew it.
We was doin' ok till chan showed up.
"Well, it's Finn's turn, baby."
"Those shadowkhan are gonna be my slaves,"
'cause nobody's taking this mask from <i> me.</i>
Not!
Told ya.
Ohh...
I hate fish.
Jackie: Tohru!
"Go, go, go!"
"Finn, chow, and ratso: Not!"
Heh heh heh.
Look what washed up on deck.
Jade! What are you doing here?
Heh. It looks like I'm catch of the day.
"Give me back my mask, chan..."
Or it's anchors aweigh for your niece.
"So, what's it gonna be, chan..."
The kid or the mask?
Unh!
All: Aah!
(Panting)
"Come here, you!"
Hunh! Hah!
Hyah!
Unh! Unh!
Here!
Yee-ha!
Unh!
Huh?
I...
Hate...
Fish.
"Tohru, gun it!"
"Ahoy, maties!"
"Oh, man."
Tarakudo's gonna have our heads.
That could be arranged.
(All gasp)
"Jade: Uncle, we're back!"
"Jackie: And this time,"
the mask did not wind up on anyone's face.
We rule!
Ohh...
"I will ""rule"" after a nice hot bath."
Ow!
"No time for rest, tohru."
Uncle has located Japanese encyclopedia of evil.
You must research way to defeat tarakudo
and put end to oni mask quest.
"Yes, sensei."
One more thing:
Do not forget to sweep.
"Tohru: Yes, sensei."
One more thing:
Sink is clogged.
Please plunge!
"Yes, sensei."
One <i> more</i> thing...
Pee-ewh!
Rotten fish!
Take a bath!
One more thing...
No more things!
(Gasps)
You disrespect uncle?
"Uncle took you in,"
"put roof over your head,"
put food in your belly--
<i>lots</i> of food--
and this is how you repay me?!
"I cook, I clean,"
"I travel the world to be smothered in fish,"
and you thank me by demanding many more things?
Both: I will never speak to you again!
Oh!
Come on now!
You two are like family.
You have so much to talk about.
Jade: Tch.
Like how come our new buddy
has a full-page ad in <i> demons illustrated?</i>
"""...and he was known as ikazuki,"
"the most fearsome of the oni generals."""
(Slurping)
Jackie!
Please tell tohru to refrain
from making slurping sounds.
"Uh, uncle said--"
"Jade, please tell sensei"
that I will eat my dinner however I please.
Uh--
please ask tohru
if he would like piece of uncle for dessert!
Jade: Uh...
Uncle says you're doing great.
Keep reading.
"Tohru: ""A natural leader,"
"""ikazuki was second in command"
"""to the lord of all oni,"
"tarakudo, king of the shadowkhan."""
And?
The chapter ends.
"Well, betcha he could tell us"
how to take down tarakudo once and for all.
"Perhaps, but I do not think it is possible"
"to interrogate a mask, Jade."
Oh?
If you wanna talk to an inanimate mask...
Try the talisman that brings motion to the motionless.
Are we sure dabbling with dark forces
is the best idea?
Ikazuki lives!
Bow before my mighty form and--
where <i> is</i> my mighty form?
Insolent humans.
You shall pay for your trickery
at the hands of my shadowkhan!
(Growls)
Ahem.
At the hands of my shadowkhan!
The masks may only summon shadowkhan
"if they are whole,"
attached to a human host.
"Jade, please tell tohru"
not to state obvious.
"Uncle says ""duh."""
"Ok, Jackie..."
"Good cop, bad cop."
"Uh, hello, Mr. ikazuki-San."
We were wondering
if maybe you might tell us how to defeat tarakudo?
I shall devour your brains!
Aah!
"All right, you half-baked arts and crafts project,"
start talking or I'll redecorate your mug
with macaroni and puffy paint!
"Please, we just need to know--"
I have a glue gun
and I'm not afraid to use it.
"Your threats do not interest me,"
but he does.
M-me?
"With my magnificent face atop your mighty form,"
we would be unstoppable.
"Uh, no, but I--I do not want, uh..."
"Jade, please tell tohru to stop quivering like frightened chihuahua!"
Please tell the scowling Billy goat
that I am not frightened.
"Uh, easy there, boys."
Please tell tohru that uncle will give him
something to be frightened about!
Please tell sensei that I would like to see him try!
Stop! We should not be arguing with each other.
We should be questioning the mask.
"Um, what mask?"
Aiyaa!
It is gone!
How?! It is a mask!
It did not just get up and walk away.
Did it?
"Ollie, Ollie, oxen free?!"
"If ikazuki gets loose,"
he could wind up on someone's face.
And be able to summon his shadowkhan.
Finn: Jelly!
Mmm. You gonna eat that?
"Hey, dunk in our own coffee."
Boo.
Pbbt!
Whoa!
A cup of talkin' Joe.
I sense that that mask is again within our reach.
Place me upon your face...
Now!
Aah! - Aah!
Ai! Uhh! Oy!
Any sign of masky?
Nada. - Uh-uh.
"Well, our psychic leader says it's around here somewhere."
That's it. I'm tired of hoofin' it.
Let's motor--whoa--ooh!
Ikazuki lives!
Bow before my mighty form!
Uhh! This is not happening.
This is not happening!
No way I'm bowin' to Finn's tuccus.
Jade: So we just go back to uncle's and use the Hana fuda cards
to find the mask again.
"No biggie, right?"
"Yes, biggie!"
Hana fuda cards work only once per mask.
"After mask is found, cards are wiped clean!"
"Jade, please tell sensei that we should conjure a locator spell."
"Jackie, please tell tohru that proper locator spell"
"will take too long to make,"
not that I could hear him.
"Ooh, please!"
I am tired of listening to you two not talk.
"The mask escaped because you two were fighting,"
"and if you keep fighting, it will wind up on an innocent face"
before we can find it.
Aiyaa!
Tell ex-apprentice he did not give uncle mask removal potion!
Please tell sensei that his ex-apprentice
has it covered.
Remove your hands from my face!
Remove your face from my cheeks!
"Uh, Finn, I don't think he's letting go."
"Yeah, once the mask is on, only good magic'll pull it off, remember?"
You need one of them <i>removal</i> potions.
In that case...
Whoa!
I will have to make do for the time being.
(Sobs) Whoa.
Lizard says mask is this way.
Blowfish says the mask is that way.
Please tell tohru uncle's lizard
has seniority over his blowfish.
"Ohh, I give up."
Please tell sensei...
Ohh...
I have the willies.
And I'm guessing they're why.
"General ikazuki,"
how good to see you.
You're looking rather... Heinous.
"Oh, help me out, tarakudo-mundo."
Your guy's really giving me a wedgie!
"Pipe down, wart!"
"Indeed, lord tarakudo,"
I must seek a more suitable host.
Tohru: Raah!
It would seem my search is already over.
Huh?
Hello? Rude to stare.
(Gasps) Aiyaa.
The demon from planet ura--
"Jade! Er, Neptune."
"Shadowkhan, attack!"
Huh?
Shadow swords?
<i>Dokeru kimen yaaku...</i>
Grr...
"Jade: Look what someone tossed out, tarakudo."
Some perfectly good <i>oni</i> poison.
"No, anything but onions!"
Aah! Aah! My eyes! My eyes!
Hmph! - Hmph!
Take the giant.
"Jade, please tell tohru to look out behind..."
Aiyaa!
Tohru? - Tohru? Tohru?
The giant will make a most suitable host.
"Yeah, better ""t"" than me."
"Hey, say, Eddie,"
chance we could swing by a bathroom?
No!
Huh?
"Oh, no."
Tohru.
Uncle: Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
"Uncle, please."
"No, uncle has it coming."
"Ow! Uncle had opportunity to warn tohru,"
but did he? No!
All because of silly argument.
Now my apprentice is in danger of becoming demon.
Ow! One more thing:
Tohru was right.
"Uncle says ""one more thing"" too often!"
"Do not worry, uncle."
Ikazuki cannot remove himself from Finn
"without the mask removal potion,"
and that is safe and sound.
In tohru's pocket?
Ohh. Bad day.
We must find tohru before ikazuki finds potion
and places himself on tohru's face!
But how do we find tohru?
He got sucked into the shadows.
Exactly.
Ikazuki: They tell me you are a conjurer of good magic.
"They tell me you are the maker of mask removal potions,"
so provide me with the potion I require!
Your breath smells like Finn's underwear.
"Dude, let me have a crack at it."
"Tohru, t-man, buddy."
"Look, maybe you haven't noticed,"
"but I kind of have a face on my sitting place,"
so I was wondering if you could be a pal and--
"the potion, or I shall feast upon your brains!"
"Ohh, the old good cop, bad cop."
"Come on, ""t"", help me out here."
I <i> really</i> need a potty break.
Insolent slug!
I command you to produce the--
potion.
Ohh...
"And to guide us to him, a strand of tohru's hair."
He never did unclog sink.
Uncle are we sure dabbling with shadow magic is the best idea?
"If we are to find where shadowkhan are keeping tohru,"
"then like shadowkhan,"
we must travel through shadow.
Uncle!
Jackie!
Whoa! - Whoa! - Whoa!
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
Remove the wart from me
and place my glorious face upon the giant's mighty form.
"Whoo-hoo! Free at last, baby."
No. Anything but <i> oni.</i>
"Well, what are you waiting for?!"
"Uh, well, this is kind of awkward."
Simpleton!
Do as you are told!
What he said.
"Ok, but we are never gonna bring this up again."
I'm not even here.
Attack!
Uncle: Tohru!
Sensei.
"Uh, glad you guys are talking again,"
but talk later!
Hyah! - Hyah!
Tohru! Where is the potion?!
"Uh, Jackie?"
Here goes nothing.
"Not now, fool!"
I would lose control of my shadowkhan
for the brief duration my face is between hosts!
Tohru! Behind you!
"Sensei, watch out!"
Hyah! - Aah!
"Jackie, watch your behind--er, behind you!"
Graah!
Whoa! Ohh...
"Jade: Yo, Finn! Heeyah!"
Whoa!
Talk about your ancient art of butt whoop--ohh!
Uhh...
"Ratso, low 5!"
Yes!
Ohh...
No. No!
No.
No!
"End of the line, wart."
Infidel. I will have my revenge!
Uh...Gotta go.
Heh heh heh heh. Heh heh heh heh.
"Fools, I shall claim a new mighty form"
and devour your--
"blah, blah, blah."
"Thank you, Jade."
"Yes, all that chatter was giving uncle headache."
"Besides, there are others whom I would rather hear speak."
"Likewise, sensei."
"Chow: Hey, yo, Finn."
"What's the big rush? - Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!"
"Hey, Jackie, - do you like to eat raw fish?"
"Yeah, raw fish, yes, I do."
"When I eat Japanese food, and the Sushi,"
"I do eat raw fish,"
but I have to put a lot of wasabi.
"Sometimes I ask myself, ""do I like raw fish or wasabi?"" I don't know."
"But you give me raw fish, I don't like it,"
"but with wasabi, yes."
I like raw fish.
Ohh.
The lengths to which I will go for...
An <i> oni</i> mask.
Grr!
Ooh.
I know what I'm wearing for Halloween.
(Muffled yell)
Uhh!
Waah!
Ohh! Hyah!
Uhh!
Happy Halloween. Looking for a mask?
That one!
Uhh!
Whoa! Ooh!
All: Ohh.
Heh. <i> Oni?</i>
Nice try.
Ohh!
Uhh!
Chow: It's in here somewhere.
"Trick for you, treat for me."
"Jackie: I have the mask right here,"
safe inside section 13.
Uncle: So there is no need to make
mask removal potion?
"Not this time, uncle."
The only masks you will see tonight
will be on the faces of trick-or-treating children.
"Aaaaah! Oh, Jade!"
"Who is Jade? I am oni boo-boo,"
mistress of the dark.
Ooh. Makeup?
Ohh.
"Jade, you shouldn't scare people like that."
Tch. Scaring's the whole point
"of Halloween, Jackie,"
and I have to win the scariest costume award
at school tonight.
"But of all things, you had to choose--"
I don't know anything scarier-looking
than an <i> oni</i> demon. Do you?
"Now, come on. Time's a-wastin'."
We have to get at least an hour
of trick-or-treating before the fright fair.
Whoa!
Jade: Captain black.
Nice chicken suit.
"Actually, bald eagle."
And it seems you're the only one
"who read my ""dress for the day"" memo."
"<i>Buenos noches,</i> <i>mis amigos.</i>"
You and El toro fuerte.
"This is no costume, captain black."
This is a way of life.
<i>Pollo?</i>
(Sighs) Bald e--
"oh, never mind."
"El toro, I'm so glad you could join us"
for Halloween.
"And next year, you and Jade must join us"
"in Mexico for <i> El</i> <i>da de los muertos,</i>"
the day of the dead.
Where is the boy wonder paco?
Paco: I think you mean...
El paco fuerte!
Are you prepared to face wrestling's
second-mightiest champion next to El toro?
"Let's rumble, tumbelina."
"No, paco."
Someone could get hurt.
Someone?
Meaning me?
"Uh, no. Um..."
"What I meant to say is, uh..."
Never forget the first rule of <i> lucha libre.</i>
No wrestling outside the ring.
You think wrestling's second-mightiest champion
can be defeated by a girl?
"Oh, no! - Of course not, paco."
"Hands down, you're king of the ring."
But the queen of scream is gonna beat the pants off you
in tonight's costume contest.
You do not think my mask is worthy?
Sure...
If you're going as a skier.
First prize goes to the scariest costume.
Heh heh. Look at the time.
We had better get trick-or-treating
before the witching hour strikes.
"Yes! Come, children."
"Perhaps I am not cut out for this ""Halloween."""
Ooh.
A face even scarier than Jade's.
Chow: No.
Not it. Nuh-uh.
No.
Aw!
We're missin' out on all the trick-or-treatin'.
Gentlemen.
Whoa! Tarakudo!
Pop quiz.
"Why is Jackie chan not also here,"
searching for the mask?
Uh...
Answer--because Mr. chan already has the mask.
Ohh! I knew that.
End of quiz.
Now for the pop.
Aah! - Aah!
Ohh! - Ohh!
Can we knock on uncle's door first?
My demon duds'll blow his mind.
Oh! The <i> oni</i> mask!
Where is paco?
Where is the mask?!
Do you think I am scary now?
Ohh! - Copycat!
"Jade, I do not think paco is wearing makeup."
Oh.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
"Paco, your face?"
"Uh, paco is wearing a mask"
which we must have magically removed.
Immediately.
"I am sorry,"
but we <i> luchadores</i> never remove our masks.
That is my paco.
"El toro, that is no ordinary mask."
Jade: Paco...
Just stay calm till uncle gets here.
Then we can put this whole thing behind us
and get on with our trick-or-treating.
Trick-or-treating?
A fine idea.
Paco!
No!
(Rings)
Hello?
"Jackie, uncle is very busy right now."
(Doorbell rings)
Tohru! Candy!
"Coming, <i> sensei.</i>"
Bzzz! Bzzz!
"Arrr, Matey!"
Raaagh!
Why must uncle devise removal potion now?
Very nice Japanese <i>oni</i> demon costume.
"Happy Halloween. Thank you, good-bye."
Nice? Nice?!
I am scary!
Grr!
Who put new <i> oni</i> mask on face?
How could you not see him
when he was right under your nose!
"Uh, <i> sensei?</i>"
Aiyaaa!
"Quickly, tohru."
We must prepare mask removal potion.
I have <i> mucho</i> competition in the scary department.
"Believe me,"
you have no competition.
Ohh! Are you the great pumpkin?
Uh...Indeed.
"And I'm here to show all ghoulies, goblins, and demons"
how to be as scary as they can be.
"Teach me, great one."
"All you need to do is feel the power,"
call upon the darkness within...
"So, this mask is stuck to paco's face?"
And we need to unstick it before paco figures out
how to summon his shadowkhan.
(Doorbell rings)
Whoa! Those are some crazy...
Costumes?
Trick or treat.
Grr!
"Paco: If you offer no treat,"
then we must trick!
No!
No! No! No! Go away!
(Whimpers)
Mmm. <i> Delicioso.</i>
You passed your first test with flying colors.
Next on the to-do list:
Bathing the earth in darkness.
El toro: You there!
Step away from <i>mi paquito.</i>
I'm sorry.
"This little devil bows to a new master,"
masked man.
"Indeed, El toro."
I am no longer your little towel boy.
I am El paco diablo!
Who is this <i>cabeza gigante?</i>
Taraku--oh.
"Yes, that is a very lovely costume,"
but I am busy right now.
"Do not touch the mask, children."
"Jade: Uh, guys?"
I don't think these are trick-or-treaters.
Shadowkhan.
"Slimy, slithering,"
made-for-Halloween shadowkhan.
Yaaah!
Uhh!
I hope uncle's almost ready with that potion.
Twick or tweat.
Bzzz. Bzzz.
Happy Halloween.
"Uncle: Tohru, scale of lizard!"
"(Doorbell rings) Tohru, door!"
Bzzz. - Happy Halloween.
"Uncle: Tohru, wolfbane!"
(Doorbell rings) Door!
Uncle: Sulfur root!
(Doorbell rings) Door!
"Eye of newt! No, left eye of newt!"
(Doorbell rings) Door!
Special ingredient.
Tentacle of Japanese octopus.
(Doorbell rings) Door!
(Gasping)
Trick or treat.
"Tohru, uncle needs octopus tentacle now!"
Uncle: Candy?
"Oh, no."
Aiyaaa!
"Gnarly, dude!"
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!
Ohh! Aah!
Uhh!
Sorry.
"The shadowkhan are excellent minions of darkness,"
"are they not, Jade?"
"Tarakudo: Spiffy costume, little lady."
Rehearsing your inevitable return
to the dark side?
"Maybe so, tarakudo."
Jade: Stop!
"I, oni boo-boo,"
call upon the darkness within me
to command you ninjas to stand down!
Heh heh. Worth a try.
Still you attempt to outdo me?
"Ha ha! We shall see, once and for all,"
who is truly the scariest.
Shadowkhan!
Jackieee!
No!
Uhh! - Aah!
(Together) Ohh.
"Jackie, how is it possible"
to defeat a floating head?
Hmm.
(Doorbell rings)
"Uh, trick or treat?"
"<i>Gracias,</i> but I am on a special diet."
Do you have onions?
Uhh!
"Let go of me, you slugs!"
Jade! Uhh!
Jackieeeeee--
uhh!
Aah!
"Tsk, tsk, tsk, Mr. chan."
No mask?
Tarakudo: Much better.
Jackie o'lantern.
And now it's time to send you to the pumpkin patch.
(Sniffs)
I would prefer...
The onion field!
Aah!
Aah! My eyes!
My eyes!
But where are paco and Jade?
Paco wants to prove he is scariest.
Tohru...
Jackie: Meet us at Jade's school
with the mask removal potion.
"Uh, we will be there,"
"uh, shortly, Jackie."
"Do not worry, tohru."
How hard can it be to find boy
in ghost costume?
(Gasps)
"Hey, come on."
You kids need a ticket like everybody else.
What are you?
Eww!
This job don't pay enough!
(Roars)
(Excited yelling)
Ha ha.
No contest.
"I am the scariest, which means you"
no longer need to wear a mask.
Heh. But I'm not wearing a mask.
I know.
I am the winner.
And second place...
Loses face!
(Gulps)
(Weakly) Let's rumble.
Rrahhr!
Halt!
El toro: There will be no fighting here.
Grr!
And why not?
Uh...
Because you know the first rule
of <i> lucha libre.</i>
No wrestling outside the ring.
I would not want to break any rules.
"Now, El toro,"
prepare to surrender your title
to El paco diablo!
I will simply keep the little one pinned
until your uncle arrives with the magic potion.
"Do not let paco's size fool you, El toro."
Cabo cannonball!
Hrrahh!
"Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark."
Where is uncle?
"Dude, check out what this big Bumblebee guy gave me."
It's like some kinda suction cup candy.
"(Together) Ooh, cool!"
"Please, you do not want to eat that."
"Hands off, dude. It's mine!"
Trade you.
Natchez knee-dropper. - Ohh!
Ohh.
I will pin paco
after a brief siesta.
"We gonna wait for El toro to tag us,"
or are we gonna--
Jade! Uhh!
Palenque pile-driver!
Jalisco hammer-down!
Tijuana twister!
Ohh!
"Smash him, El toro!"
"Jade, it is still paco."
Heh heh. Sorry.
I was in the moment.
Ohh.
You know the second rule
"of <i> lucha libre,</i> don't you, El toro?"
The winner may remove the loser's mask!
"Uncle: Speaking of mask removal,"
¶ uncle has a treat for you ¶
"float like a buccaneer, sting like a bee."
Aiyaaa!
You did not tell uncle
new shadowkhan can stretch like Taffy!
Jackie!
Uhh!
(Gasping together)
Uhh! Aah!
Aah!
"Well, there goes our last pair of free hands."
Unless you count demon boy.
"Paco, you must remove your mask."
"Why would I want to do that, loser?"
"I am not talking to you, demon."
I am talking to the paco behind your mask.
"But, El toro, you know the <i> luchador</i>"
must never remove his own mask.
That rule must now be broken
by both of us.
(Gasps) El toro...
Why?!
"Now, paco,"
it is your turn.
El toro: Use the potion to remove the mask!
Do not listen!
¶ La la la la la la la la ¶
no!
I must remove the mask.
Uhh!
"Jade: Do it, paco!"
Go for the potion!
Magic must defeat magic!
Remove the mask.
"No, remain a demon!"
Remove the mask.
Remain a demon!
Remove. Remain!
Uhh! Remove!
Remain!
Remove the mask.
"Yes, paco!"
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Nooo!
Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!
Buh-bye.
No more Halloween horror from you.
"El toro,"
I think I have been a very bad little <i> luchador.</i>
"Paquito, you may be small of stature,"
but your inner strength
knows no bounds.
"Jade: Here, paco."
I think this belongs to you.
Because I was the scariest?
Puh-leeze!
That honor would belong to <i> moi.</i>
"But tonight, you're the champ."
You should have seen yourself
smacking your bad self down.
The palenque piledriver! Hunh!
The jalisco hammerdown huwah!
The fuerte face-puller! Yaah!
"Paco, you were in the zone."
"Hey, Jackie,"
do you like scary movies?
"Scary movies, yes. Actually..."
"Because I'm a filmmaker,"
"I like scary movies, drama, comedy, action."
"But when I watch a scary movie,"
not nighttime.
"You know, really, after you are watching"
"you fall asleep, you can't sleep."
"So, comedy at night. Daytime, scary."
"Jackie: If the Hana fuda cards are correct,"
then the next <i> oni</i> mask...
Has gotta be...There!
Where is card indicating mask removal ingredient?
"Right here, unc. Whoop--"
aiyaa!
(All gasp)
Whew!
Snatched from the jaws of defeat.
Whoa!
"Well, at least you guys got a good look"
at the ingredient on the card...Right?
Heh heh.
No removal ingredient? No problem.
We just make mega-sure
no one wears the mask this time. Right?
(Gasp)
Dark magic resides here.
"Quickly, we must find mask before--"
"hey, wait a sec."
I've seen this place... On TV!
We're in miss Kimber's psychic shack.
Miss who's psychic what?
"Miss Kimber, from the psychic hot line."
Duh.
Pfft!
No one can see future.
All psychics are--
phonies? Ha ha ha ha ha.
I knew you was gonna say that.
Whoa! She's good!
A cheap trick.
Fortune teller saw us approach.
Hmm. But she's very skilled dollmaker.
"You are here for the mask, hmm?"
(Gasp) How do you know this?
"The boy's not too quick on the uptake, huh?"
"I'm psychic, hon."
Ho ho ho.
Then I guess you knew we'd be taking it.
Thank you.
Hmm.
"The stars don't say you take it, sugar."
He does.
"Jackie, Jade: Hak foo?"
(Scoffs) Stars do not talk.
Hak foo: So <i> that</i> is the mask...
Destined for my face.
"Jackie, take mask!"
"I knew he was going to say that, too."
Whoa!
Whoo! Aah! Oh!
"Oh, sorry. Aah!"
"Jade: Faster, Jackie, he's gaining!"
Jade! This is...
Dangerous?
"Hey, I must be psychic."
"And what do you think you're whipping up, sugar?"
"If you can truly see future,"
you would know uncle is devising removal spell
in case mask is worn by hak foo.
Only...Uncle must learn
of missing key ingredient.
(Gasp) You hear that?
The stars are talking.
And they say you can have the answer you seek
revealed by yours truly for only 9.95 a minute.
(Gasp) You are fraud...
And money grubber!
Unh! Unh!
Whoa!
All hands on deck!
Hyah!
Unh! Unh!
Whoa!
Uhh!
Hyah!
Aah! Ooh!
"Uh, not too much off the top, please."
Let him go!
"Uh, Jade, who is steering?"
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
And here is prediction for you:
I see piece of uncle in your future!
"Whenever you're done, hon,"
you're gonna want to scooch a tad to the left.
(Boat approaching)
Whoa! Aah! Whoa!
Unh! Oh!
Whoa! Unh!
Mud slide!
(Groaning)
"Jade, where is the mask?"
At last!
Uh...Found it.
"And now, chans,"
prepare to meet the fiercest tribe
of shadowkhan yet--
mine.
Demon summons ninja army!
(Both gasp)
They--they are--
they are so...
Cute!
(Growling)
Demon compensates for inferior ninja army!
Unh! Ooh!
Uhh! Uh!
No! Aah!
"Jackie, grab on!"
Jackie!
"I will not see you later, alligator."
(Grumbling)
...little shrimps!
Jackie?
(Gasping for air)
"Ah, Jackie,"
you are trying to find card
with mask removal ingredient?
"No, uncle."
I am trying not to become alligator bait!
"Well, you must learn to multi-task."
Now come. We must research mask removal ingre--
ah...Teeny tiny shadowkhan.
Mmm...Milk and--
uncle: Tohru! Research!
Crumbs.
Oh...I hope you do not mind
if we roll out the futons.
Jade: Good night.
This is monumental.
Never before have we captured a shadowkhan.
It is...So cute!
Do not be deceived by appearances.
Uncle will bring Japanese reference book
so you can get busy.
Who knows what close study of our captive may uncover.
"(Sighs) Yes, <i> sensei.</i>"
(Glass jar rattles)
Cookie-eating shadowkhan.
Huh?
My shadow!
Ohh...
<i>Sensei.</i>
One more thing.
Keep blowfish handy.
Cannot be too careful with--
(thud)
(Gasp) Ooh.
(Tohru snoring)
(Glass jar clinks)
(Gasp)
(Growling)
Aiyaaa!
(Snarling)
(Gasp)
Aah!
Uncle!
(Growling)
(Growling)
"Jackie, fire blowfish!"
Uncle is waiting!
Jade: I got it!
Fish fry!
Ooh!
Tohru is in very deep sleep.
Shadows contain our yin--
one half of our chi.
Clearly this shadowkhan tribe grows stronger
by feeding upon human shadows.
"And without this part of our life force,"
we are doomed to a state of limbo.
"Well, how can we get tohru's shadow back?"
"We must end hak foo's control over his shadowkhan,"
but we cannot remove mask from him
without spell ingredient.
Hmph! Stupid gator!
"And without tohru to translate Japanese,"
learning spell ingredient will be difficult.
"Well, until you do,"
that shadow eater is out there.
We must find it before it harms anyone else.
Ninja hunt.
Do not be foolish.
Your own shadows are at risk.
T'ch.
"If the li'l freaks are hungry,"
they can eat this! Hyah!
Jade: Oops.
Aaah!
The way to keep shadow eaters
from eating shadow
is to not cast one.
"Now, exhale and..."
Attack!
Hak foo: - Fight like warriors!
Eye of the tiger! Eye of the tiger!
How charming.
Grr! Show master tarakudo your war faces!
"Ooh. If I had a spine,"
it would be tingling.
Grr!
"Hak foo, all shadowkhan are deadly."
You just need to be aware of their strengths.
You call these strong?
I see a demonstration is in order.
Chow: Aah!
Hello!
Kinda in the middle of something here!
Ho ho ho.
Where'd you get the mini-'Khan?
Grrrrr!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Wait for it.
(Whistles)
"Tarakudo: Uh, fellas?"
"Chow: Ha! Hey, hak, are these guys"
on loan from Santa?
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
"Hey, how-- what are you--"
(gasp)
Ohh. Uhh.
Growing boys need their nutrients.
And an entire city of shadows
awaits my army!
Uncle: Ninja-suction unit?
Check.
Chi-powered night-vision goggles?
Check.
Hand-held dark chi detector?
Check.
"And, in case back-up is needed..."
Check!
"Base potion, in the event uncle discovers"
missing ingredient for removal spell.
(Sigh) Uncle will remain here
armed with Japanese-to-Chinese dictionary.
Let's bring tohru back from dreamland.
(Crackling)
We found tohru's shadow eater.
More like a new batch of shadow eaters.
Run!
(Gasp)
Huh? (Crackles)
Ooh! Ooh!
Bwaaa! Whoa. Ninja swarm.
"don't worry, Jackie. No shadow, no lunch."
Uhh!
Aah! Ohh!
You've been hosed.
"(Sigh) Thank you, Jade."
"""Substitute mask removal ingredient is often"
"shoelace of giraffe."""
Aiyaaa!
Giraffes do not wear shoes!
"Jade chan, pest control."
Huh!
Huh?
My bag is full.
I'm betting this little guy
will lead us to the big one
who munched tohru's shadow.
Oh! Jade?
Uh...
Found our boy.
And he has been snacking between meals.
Ohh! Ohh!
(Growling)
"I thought you were gator food, chan."
Time to hand over tohru's shadow.
Huh?
"Jackie, he's too big!"
"Jade, run!"
"Run after tiny, right!"
And stay out of the light!
"Uh, Jackie..."
That may be a problem.
"Good morning, chan..."
And good night.
Bear feeds on honey!
Uhh!
Uhh! Whaa!
"Where is that removal spell, uncle?"
(Sighs)
"Japanese translation is not going well, tohru."
Unless ingredient we seek is
"""lobster wearing corduroy pants."""
(Softly) Aiyaaa.
Hmm?
(Gasp) You!
"Looks like you in need of some good fortune, sugar."
Who says uncle needs fortune?!
Hmm?
"Phone me now, and we can fix whatever is ailing you..."
Together.
"Pfft! If uncle wanted quack,"
he would phone take-out for Peking duck!
Only <i> I</i> have the answers you seek.
Ohhh!
Oh!
Ooh!
"Imagine, chan,"
"an army of these creatures,"
obeying my every command!
Huh! Aah!
"Come on out, tiny."
don't you want to party with your pals?
Whoa!
Unh!
Grrrr!
(Click click)
There's more than one way to skin a ninja!
Gone fishin'.
(Blows)
(Sigh)
"For you, my apprentice."
(Ring)
"Welcome to miss Kimber's psychic hotline,"
where I reveal what the stars tell.
Uncle needs helps finding mask-removal ingredient
and for you to never speak of this to anyone!
Yes. Yes. I see.
And it's high time you pursued your true passion.
(Gasp)
Oil painting?!
That's right.
'Cause the stars say
uncle needs to take time out for <i> uncle.</i>
(Gasp)
It is like you have window into uncle's soul.
"Here, tiny!"
(Kissy sounds)
"Here, boy. Come on. Where are you?"
(Rumbling)
"Oh, boy."
"You may have survived a gator, chan,"
but how about a land shark?!
(Sniffing)
Grrr! Enough with the shadow puppets!
Rrrr! Oh!
It's chow time.
(Distant pounding and shaking)
Huh! Uh!
"Jackie, I think tiny had a big breakfast."
(Roar)
Now <i> that's</i> what I call a warrior!
(Cell phone rings)
Uncle?
"Jackie, if psychic speaks truth,"
there is good chance uncle will be taking unexpected trip.
"Oh, the mask-removal ingredient is fish."
"Oh! Uncle, we are about to be swallowed by a whale!"
Where are we supposed to find a fish
in the middle of downtown?!
Duh!
"Hit it, unc!"
"Uncle, on phone: <i>Dokeru kimen yaaku.</i>"
<i>Dokeru kimen yaaku.</i>
Uhh!
(Struggling)
Whoa!
Aah!
Oof!
Ohhh!
Jade: Think one of those belongs to tohru?
"Jackie, all is right again."
(Groan)
<i>Sensei?</i>
Aiyaaa!
"Who told you to move, tohru?"
What...What <i> is</i> that?
Oil painting.
Uncle must learn to take time out for uncle.
"If you could have a superpower, what would it be?"
"If I have superpower,"
"I can stop everything, like, ""freeze!"""
"Then, after I fix everything, ""continue."""
"Yeah, like tornado coming, I can, ""freeze."""
"Tell people, ""run away."""
"""Ok, keep coming."""
"And, yes, I'd really like to have this kind of power."
Hmm.
Peculiar little slice of americana.
"Eh, stop!"
You must not buy that mask.
"Uh, please, uh... Buy this one instead."
That's not a mask.
"Uh...Yes, it is. (Chuckles)"
"See? Unhh! Oh, boy."
Uh...Uhh!
"If you want the mask, it'll be for sale"
"on my web site,"
www. Alfiesantiqueauctions. Com.
"You've been deleted, Alfie."
Whoa!
Jackie: I will take that.
Chan!
Crack his skull.
I will send you a check for this later. Thank you.
Screaming eagle feet!
Bwaa!
Yeeckk!
Crying puppy feet!
Crying puppy feet!
Aaahh!
Why...Won't...This... Come...Off?
(Grunting)
Uhh! Unhh!
(Gasps)
Aah!
Uhh! Ohh!
Baahh! Ohh!
Angry fist avenges feet!
Www.Alfiesantiqueauctions.Com?
Oh...Bad day.
Uncle: Www dot what? Dot who?
Ow!
"Uncle sent you to find oni mask,"
and you return with gibberish!
Jade: Hello?
It's not gibberish.
It's a site on the web!
"Ohh, the mask has been taken by giant spider?!"
The world wide web.
It's for sale - on the Internet. See?
(Uncle mumbles)
So many antiques... For sale?
"Jade, why did you not tell uncle your waffle iron was magic?"
Ooh! Here's the oni auction.
"Chow: ""Chantastic 4""?"
You think?
"Gentlemen, start your engines."
"""Finnhalen""?"
That could only be...
Aiyaa! Bid higher!
On it!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
Got it. Got it back!
We're in. They're out.
Hello! Good-bye.
"Oh, no, you don't! Oh, yes, we do."
Aha!
And the winner is... And the winner is...
Filthyrich1?! Filthyrich1?
Who's filthyrich1?! Who's filthyrich1?!
"Jackie: According to section 13 intelligence,"
filthyrich1 lives in this apartment.
"Whoever it is,"
"I am sure that once we explain the dangers of the mask,"
they will beg us to take it away.
"Tch, unless this filthyrich1 guy"
decides he likes the idea of running his own ninja army.
Valmont?! Valmont?!
Go away.
Ohh!
You're filthyrich1?
But you're not rich...
Just filthy.
Jade: Roomy place you got here.
"I may be broke,"
"but I still have my resources,"
and I've caught wind of your little quest.
"Once I have my oni mask in hand,"
"I shall control an army of shadowkhan thieves,"
and the riches of the world will be mine!
"(Imitates buzzer) Guess again, Mr. not-so-fancy-pants."
"Believe me, valmont,"
you do not want to wear that mask.
I will do what I please with the mask
that I purchased fair and square with stolen money.
(Knock on door)
"Ahh, that must be the courier with my win."
Flying tiger kick!
"Now, was that really necessary?"
"Ratso: Ooh, bigger than my apartment."
It's a palace.
Valmont?! Valmont?! Valmont?!
You're filthyrich1?
But you're not ri--
I am fully aware of the irony.
Enough talk!
Cobra strike!
Hello?!
The mask isn't even here yet! Duh!
Stay back.
"Get out, all of you!"
The mask is mine!
Gorilla flings its--
(knock on door)
The mask removal spell is ready. Huh?!
"Tohru, no!"
(Knock on door)
Valmont: Come in!
Delivery for Mr. val--aah!
Gotcha!
Hey!
"Sorry, I can't let you have this! Thank you!"
Dragon fist!
"Got it, Jackie!"
"Uh, part of it."
Where is the other half?
Right where it belongs.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Dude!
(Chuckles)
No way! Ha ha ha!
What? What are you simpletons laughing at?
Ha ha ha!
One side of your face is normal...
And the other's all...Demony!
Hee hee hee hee!
A broken mask won't work.
Will it?
He only has half his shadowkhan?
Maybe they'll only be half as dangerous?
On the contrary.
Half is more than enough to destroy you completely!
Aah! (Gasps) Whoa.
"Yes, my shadowkhan, destroy them..."
And seize the rest of my face.
Aah!
Whoa. They're pretty gnarly for half pints.
Tohru! The potion!
We must remove valmont's mask!
I have the potion.
Uhh!
Yes!
Whoa! Whoa!
(Gasps) No!
All: Whoa!
Heh. Least I didn't drop this.
We lost the truck!
Jackie: Can you make more potion?
"The key ingredient is Japanese monkey tears,"
and <i> sensei</i> àstill has the monkey.
I will meet you both back at the shop.
Aww...
"Jade: Hey, Jackie!"
Jade!
Where are we going?
"To lock that up in section 13,"
where valmont cannot get to it.
If his shadowkhan are this powerful
"at half strength,"
I do not want to see them whole.
Bwaa! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Ahh!
Sorry! We will just get out here! Thank you!
"Jackie and Jade: Bad day, bad bay, bad day, bad day!"
Bwaa! Aah!
Jackie!
Jade! Run!
"Um, wish I could."
Maybe it's time to summon some backup.
Graah!
Kick their half-butts!
No fair! My ninjas don't have heads!
About face!
Charge!
Huh?
Jade?
"Hey, Jackie."
(Gasps)
Foul! You hit his blind side! Whoa!
"Jackie, we gotta go back."
My guys were just starting to get the upper hand!
Have you gone crazy?!
Why in the world did you put that thing on your face?!
Duh! To save us from valmont's shadowkhan.
"Besides, now that it's attached, valmont can't take it."
Ohh! But who is going to save us from you?!
"The mask is evil, Jade."
"It is a matter of time before it turns you evil, too."
"Tch, I can handle it."
"One--it's only half the evil of a regular mask,"
and 2...
"The next time you call me crazy,"
I shall devour your brains!
Heh heh. See your point.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello? Uncle: Jackie.
Uncle! Please tell me the new potion is ready.
No! Uncle cannot make more mask removal potion.
You can't?
Key ingredient is Japanese monkey tears.
But tohru said you still have the monkey!
"Monkey, yes. Tears, no!"
Japanese monkeys are not sentimental creatures.
They weep only once every 7 years!
"Besides, uncle has no time to make potion."
Too busy selling antiques
with Jade's magic waffle iron.
"Ahh, uncle could resell that ming vase at great profit."
"Buy, tohru! Buy!"
"But, uncle, we need that potion!"
Uncle: Then you must find the vial that you lost!
"Higher, tohru! Bid higher!"
Ohh. We have to find the delivery truck.
"No problem, Jackie."
I'll just order my half-a-Khan
to chase it down and--
feast upon the delicious gray matter
of the helpless mortal inside!
"No! No evil feasting,"
and I do not want you summoning the--
won't have to. There goes our truck!
Stop!
"So, you have failed to retrieve the rest of me."
"Ratso: Ohh, I thought they'd never leave."
No matter.
I am still powerful enough to empty every bank vault
in the city.
Cha-ching.
"Oh, yeah."
Now you're talking.
Wealth is insignificant!
I must become whole in order to be powerful enough
to bathe the earth in shadow!
Aww...
"Yes, master!"
What am I saying?
Money is everything to me.
"No, power is what I crave."
"Yes, because it can be used to acquire money."
Power. Money!
Power! Money!
Power! Money!
Power! Money!
"Ok, big v."
"I can tell you're a little conflicted here,"
so let me just say money--good.
"Yeah. We've been trying the world domination thing for a while,"
and it's not working out too well.
Silence!
Whoa! Aah! Hey!
I do not want your opinions!
All I want...
Is the other half of my face!
Jade?
Only then shall I be complete!
I must be complete!
"Jade, the evil within you"
is growing stronger.
You must resist it until we can find the potion.
"Well, we better find it fast,"
'cause your brains are starting to smell awful yummy.
My other half is near. I sense it!
Could we please just steal something?
Look. There's a bank right over...
(Grunts)
Ooh!
Whoopsie-Daisy.
Ohh! Darkness awaits!
But--ohh!
Wait!
(Woof woof woof)
Graah!
Heh. Nice doggie.
No.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
It's for you.
"Jade, we were in the middle of a big auction,"
and then all the icons disappeared.
"Jade: No problem, t."
Just click on the blinking supermoose in the corner and--
(demonic) Surrender your soul to the forces of darkness!
"Uh, I will figure it out on my own."
Tohru! Where is auction?!
(Gasps)
My antiques have been swallowed by shadow!
He is stopping! Thank goodness!
"Valmont, demonic: Surrender my face..."
Or face obliteration!
"Well, don't just stand there, chan!"
Be a hero and get this thing off me!
"My guys'll take him, Jackie."
Go nab the potion!
"No, I cannot let you--"
do not question me!
(Growls)
(Gasps)
I've been looking for that!
"Hey, you shouldn't be back here!"
Neither should you!
Brains!
Aah!
Whoa!
"My other half, why must we fight?"
"Uh, maybe 'cause you're evil?!"
Indeed. We are allies in darkness.
We must join forces.
"No, we mustn't!"
"I'm all right with it,"
as long as your forces join on her face.
"Shadowkhan, unite!"
"Jade, I have the--"
Jackie!
Help!
"Shadowkhan, attack!"
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
No!
"Ahh, the remedy to my affliction."
"At last, I shall be complete!"
Tch. A complete loser!
"Valmont, lather up!"
"Right, then!"
"And a-one, and a-two, grab and pull!"
(Mask snarling)
No!
Whoa! Whoa!
Huh? Jade!
Got it! Half of it.
"Uh, hello? Want the rest?"
I will sell it to you...
For half price?
Diamonds?
Take the mask!
I'm rich!
Whaa!
"Adios, valmont."
(Cell phone rings)
Tech support.
"Er, Jade, I will have to buy you a new computer."
I'm afraid <i> sensei</i> à has crashed this one.
"Tch, crashes are a cinch to fix."
Just hit the reset button and--
"uh, no, I mean he has crashed it..."
Onto the floor.
Aiyaa!
Uncle's antique auctions have vanished!
Magic waffle iron is forged from dark magic!
It is evil! Evil! Evil!
"Hey, Jackie, when did you start training in martial arts?"
I--training martial art when I was 6 1/2.
10 years Southern style.
"Then after that, I learned northern style,"
"then after that, I learned so many different style"
"like hapkido, tae Kwon do, judo,"
"uh, karate, and so many things."
"Then later on, I find out everything's the same."
"The whole thing is ""martial arts,"""
but just the title different. Yeah.
Finn: What makes the Burmese raccoon such a cool pet?
"Well, unlike ordinary raccoons,"
it won't raid your trash can.
"Ooh-ooh, you don't have to walk it or feed it."
And it's made of solid gold!
Score!
And we bagged it without any trouble from...
That guy.
"Easy does it, Jackie!"
Whoa-ohh! Eh!
Jade!
Why do you have to show up every time?
'Cause you'd miss me if I didn't.
Uhh!
Why does chan have to show up every time?
Hunh!
"Oh, give us a break, chan."
We're not even working for any forces of darkness this week.
"Yeah, we're on vacation."
Can't you let us have just one little priceless statue?
The Burmese raccoon belongs in a museum.
"Well, ratso and chow here"
are gonna put <i> you</i> àwhere <i> you</i> belong--
in a hospital.
Hyah! Unh!
Ohh! Ooh!
Ow!
Hunh! Oof!
"Hey, Finn, I'll hold that for you."
"Oh, thanks."
Hey! Give it!
Jade?
"Just one question, kiddo."
Where you gonna go?
Heh heh.
Anywhere but down?
Give up the raccoon.
Hyah! Aiee-ya!
Unh! Uhh!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hunh!
Chow: Unh!
Whoa-oh-ohh!
Ow!
Thanks.
Grab on tight!
Are we just gonna let chan get away with our nest egg?
Grab on tight!
This is gonna leave a mark-- or 3.
Aaaah! Ohh!
All: Oof!
Ohh! Aaah! Aah!
All: Unh!
So much for our wealth.
At least we have our health.
"Finn: Shut up, ratso-o-o-o-o!"
"(Finn, ratso, & chow crying out in pain)"
"The raccoon is in the museum where it belongs,"
"and I do not think we will be hearing from Finn, ratso, and chow"
any time soon.
Finn: Chan!
Tch! don't you three know when to quit?
All: We quit!
All: Huh?
We're tired of never making money.
We're tired of being enslaved
"by dragons, wizards, and floating demon heads."
"Most of all, we're tired of getting our butts kicked by you."
Yeah. It hurts.
All: We want to be good guys!
A trick! They want to rob uncle's shop!
No! We're telling the truth.
We weren't always bad guys.
Let me guess.
You sang in disco bands at weddings.
How'd you know?
"I was employee of the month at sunglass shack,"
3 times.
I studied theoretical physics.
Chow: We only went bad because we fell in with the wrong crowd.
"Yeah, each other. Ooh!"
"Oh, come on, chan, please?"
You gave big t a chance.
"Well, uh, yes..."
They have a point.
(All moaning)
"If you are truly serious about being good,"
you should go make your point to captain black.
I wish you luck.
Huh?
Aiee-yah!
Call police!
Thank you for shopping at uncle's rare finds.
Have a groovy day.
Bye-bye.
Come back soon.
(Gasps) Dark magic reversed cosmic yin and Yang
while we were getting lo mein.
"Uh-duh-uh-uh,"
"everything is fine, <i>sensei.</i>"
"Yeah, Finn, ratso, and chow spoke to captain black,"
"just like you said, Jackie."
Captain black said that since I was able
"to become such a model citizen,"
there was hope for my old cohorts.
He put them on probation.
(Gasps) In my shop?
"That's what I said, unc,"
but check it out.
These radio-controlled ankle cuffs
lets section 13 know where they are at all times.
And if they try and run for it...
See? Instant chain gang.
Ahh!
These brownies are so good.
What's your secret?
Mm-mm-mm.
You can not have the recipe
"until you prove yourself, ratso."
And you can start by doing the dishes.
"You got it, t."
Excuse me?
"Ooh! Yes, <i> sensei.</i>"
(Video game fanfare)
High score!
Unh! Uhh!
I am not worthy.
Do not steal that!
(Exhales)
Whaaaaaaw!
"Uhh, please, Finn,"
I am on the phone.
"Oop! Sorry, chan-meister."
"Hey, but how's my form?"
I'm sorry. Yes. I will leave...
As soon as I can.
"What's the scoop, j.C.?"
Big mission?
No mission. My real job.
The museum is sending me to Bhutan
to collect an artifact.
"Jackie, you can not go"
while criminals live in my shop!
Excuse me.
Ex-criminals.
"don't sweat it, unc."
Tohru can put the smack-down on his old pals
if they try anything.
And if they really get out of line...
Zappo!
Ohh! Yipe! Oof!
Oops! Sorry.
"We'll hold the fort, chan."
don't worry about us.
"Yeah. Remember,"
we're good guys now.
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
"Jackie, bad news."
The transmitters from the ankle cuffs
"show our favorite parolees in the far east,"
heading your way.
I knew they couldn't stay good for long.
But I never told them that the artifact I came here to collect
was a priceless gemstone.
I am Jackie chan from the museum.
"With your permission,"
I will bring the opal back to San Francisco.
Bad day.
"So, the whole ""good guys"" thing was an act."
"Unh! Nice move, Finn."
I see you have been practicing.
Unh! Ratso?
You have all been practicing.
Unh!
Chow?
Unh! Ohh!
"Ok, who are you guys?"
Jade: Just 3 clowns who are about to get smacked down...
By Jade's angels.
Fi--rat--ch-- Jade?
Freeze! Back away from our bosley.
"Uh, I mean, buddy."
Hunh! Hyah! Yee-aah!
Unh!
Aah! Uh-aah! Uhh!
What are you doing here?
And why did you bring them?
All part of their good-guy training.
"They can sit around at home being good,"
or they can go out and do good.
Or get smacked down real good.
"Ok, so their technique needs work,"
"but I give 'em a solid ""b"" for effort."
Uhh! Run for it!
All: Unh!
Aah! Yah! Aah!
(All groaning)
Let's finish 'em off.
"Now, Jade..."
You know your uncle Jackie would not approve.
Ohh!
"Jade's been a good influence on us,"
"and, uh, vice-versa."
"Quickly, we must get this to safety."
Heh heh! I'm sorry.
I will have the museum send you a check for the broken building.
Thank you!
"I'm telling you, Jackie,"
they're totally reformed.
I haven't thought about chain-ganging 'em once.
"Hmm, they did help out back there..."
In their own way.
And at least they're not bothering uncle anymore.
Uncle: Tohru...
Do dishes!
Can ratso not do them when he returns?
I guess I owe you all an apology.
"I thought those thieves were you,"
here for the opal.
"No harm, no foul, chan-meister."
"Besides, opal shmopal."
"Yeah, when we used to be bad guys,"
we only went after...
Big stuff.
Did you see the size of that shmopal?
"If it was ours, we'd be set for life."
But we're good guys now.
Right?
"Ok, but we have to start being good guys again"
after we steal the opal.
Sorry.
Unh! Uhh!
You guys are so grounded!
"All right, I guess that's everything."
"So, uh, thanks."
"Heh, it may not seem like it..."
But you did teach us one thing.
"Oh, and what was that?"
We're just not very good at being good guys.
I told you they couldn't be trusted.
Heh heh.
Wow! It all worked out for once.
All we had to do was be true to ourselves.
Ahh!
"All part of the journey of life, my men."
Huh?
"Yo, toss over the rock,"
and maybe I won't toss your sorry selves
down the mountain.
Ha ha ha! No way are we handing our life savings
to someone who looks like a pizza boy!
"Yo, yo, yo. This is one pizza boy"
who's gonna serve you up an extra-large whoopin'
with 2 kinds of cheese.
Waa-hah!
Ohh! Unh!
Hoo-hyah!
(All groaning)
Huh?
"Yo, strikemaster ice is in the hizzouse!"
How'd you learn to fight so good?
I was just a pizza delivery guy...
Huh? I knew it!
And it all went down one night.
I delivered a medium ham-and-pineapple
to this weird old man.
"And the fool stiffed me on the tip,"
but he told me this wild legend about the zu monastery
floating above the clouds here in the far east.
"The monks started teaching me their extreme,"
top secret style of martial arts.
It was off the hook!
But then I got hip
to what the monks really wanted with me.
They wanted to teach me the ways of peace.
"Well, I needed that bunk"
"like a pizza needs a soggy crust, yo."
They expelled me and dj fist and mc cobra
for bad behavior.
"Now, we would've kicked their bald booties,"
but we just weren't good enough to beat 'em yet.
"Uh, well, you sure kick Booty now, ice baby."
"Yeah, go whoop those monks."
You don't wanna scratch that beautiful opal
"while you're exacting your revenge, do ya?"
"Yeah, so why don't you just leave it here?"
We'll watch it for you.
"Yeah, for reals."
Let me demonstrate how this little hunk of ice
is gonna let strikemaster ice
go back to the monastery and bring down the house!
"Finn: No, no, no! don't--don't do it!"
Save it for the monks!
Mommy!
(Explosion) All: Aaaah!
"I was going to ask you to be my henchmen,"
"but if you work for strikemaster ice,"
you gots to have thicker crust.
Ohh! (Sobbing)
Easy does it.
The signal from the ankle transceivers
suggests our former reformers
haven't moved in an hour.
It could be an ambush.
Hiya!
If you let us down...
We'll help you find the shmopal.
"You know, I don't see how we can help out"
"if we're all chained up like this, partners."
You are not our partners.
You are our prisoners.
Wow! Just like the pimply kid said.
"""Floatin' above the clouds, yo, yo, yo."""
"Oh, uh, wait up!"
(Explosion)
"Yeah, see how you like preachin' peace"
with your temple in pieces.
"Lock 'em up, boys."
Whoa! Strikemaster ice is a twerp.
I can take him.
Jade.
Unh!
"Say, chan never said"
you couldn't get the drop on the other 2.
Yeah!
"Good one, Finn."
Run for it!
Unh! Uhh! Hunh!
You have done enough damage...
Wouldn't you say?
So you wanna throw down?
The greatest victory is the battle not fought.
I'll reflect on the meaning of that
while I wail on you.
Jade: Hey!
"Who cut your hair, the gardener?"
(Razzberry)
Unh! Uhh!
Warning:
Objects in mist are closer than they appear.
"You know, your crane stance could use some work."
No! No! Aah!
Sweet.
Let's make like a nose and run.
"Strikemaster ice: That's it, you're history!"
Wait.
We can't let chan go out like this.
Yeah. After all the times we tried to knock him off...
Letting someone else do the job
just doesn't seem right.
Let's rescue the chan-man.
"Uh, never mind."
"Let go, yo!"
You want it?
It is yours.
Unh!
"Hey, thanks, partner!"
"Guys, you don't want to go that way!"
"Nice try, kiddo!"
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Are they...?
I think so.
I think I may actually miss them.
I know what you mean.
"Weird, huh?"
Poor guys.
"(Sighs) You know,"
"we're not very good at being bad guys, either."
"Hey Jackie, do you believe in giving people second chances?"
"Yes, yes."
I always give people a second chance.
"Like my stunt men, some of my assistants..."
"They do something wrong,"
I give them another chance.
"They do something wrong again,"
"I give them third chance, not just a second chance."
I always give them second chance.
More than second.
"We should be home preparing to celebrate Chinese new year,"
not running around on a wild goose chase.
Uncle's new <i> chi</i> detector
registers disturbing levels of dark <i> chi.</i>
"Are you sure, uncle?"
"You jury-rigged an old metal detector,"
and we are in a--
"is it just me,"
or is this place a dump?
"Aah! Jade, what are you doing here?"
Spending Chinese new year with my loved ones.
<i>(Chi</i> detector crackles)
(Gasps)
Dark <i> chi!</i>
You're not supposed to be here.
I must be running late.
For what? Halloween?
"Look, Jade has to get out of here...Now!"
Me? What'd I--
hey! How do you know my name?
"Who are you,"
and what do you want with Jade?
Not me. Him!
(Gasps) Dark <i> chi.</i>
Look out!
Aah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Dark magic?
He won't be down for long. Let's go!
Jade is not going anywhere.
Hyah! (Grunts)
Whoa!
"Sorry, but I don't have time to negotiate."
I said Jade stays.
Who is this stranger?
"Beats me, but she kinda rocks."
Heyee!
"Nephew has slow reflexes,"
but if you want piece of uncle...
Jade!
(Sniffs)
Stranger uses good <i> chi</i> magic?
"Good or bad, she kidnapped Jade."
You find Jade.
Uncle will find dark <i> chi.</i>
I think I'm gonna hurl!
This from the girl who rode the pukinator
10 times in a row at moose world?
Jade: Hey... How'd you know that?
Talk later.
"Now, wait a second!"
"We have to keep moving, Jade."
Trust me.
Uncle Jackie told me--
"to never trust strangers,"
"never chew - with your mouth open,"
and never spit into the wind.
Duh.
Whoa. Time out.
Are you...
You?
Took you long enough.
"If you're me, then you must be..."
From the future!
Double bonus score.
But how? Why?
I'll give you the download on the way.
(Whistles)
I learned to whistle like that?
Cool!
Jade!
(Ice cream truck jingles)
Follow that cab!
I will buy an ice cream.
A dozen.
Deal.
Jade: So they have - time machines in the future?
How old do I look?
I used one of uncle's spells.
Hey... Do I ever get braces?
No.
Acne?
Some.
Wild threads like those?
Section 13 standard wear.
I grow up to be a section 13 agent?!
Boss. You take--
I took over for captain black
after he was transferred to the east coast
to start up section 14.
Me?! The big cheese of section 13?!
We rock!
So why didn't you just tell Jackie and uncle who you were back there?
Didn't have time to convince them.
Too busy trying to save the future.
From what?
Him! Shendu's son.
Please. Call me drago.
"Hey, you two related?"
Because I definitely see a resemblance here.
"Resemble this, junior!"
Aah!
That's how you blasted him in the junk yard.
The dragon talisman:
Never leave the future without it.
Whoa! Whoa!
(Grunts)
Drago's a hothead.
"Like father, like son."
Dive! Unh!
Fire magic. - It does a talisman good.
Good news is
we still have one just like it
in the vault at section 13.
Bad news is we're not at section 13.
Whoa! Whoa!
Heh. Parade float.
Heh. Chinese new year.
"Well, Jade..."
"We played follow the leader into the past,"
so why not hide-and-seek?
"You distract lizard lips,"
and I'll jump him from behind.
Wha--
"if drago bumps you off in the present,"
"I could pop right out of existence,"
and the future'll be history.
Whoa. This time travel stuff is freaky.
Kick some tail!
(Grunts)
"Look, Jade has nothing to do with this."
Talk later! Talk later!
"Ahh, Mr. Jackie chan. My <i> dad</i> sends his best."
Your father? Who is your father?
"Aah! Never mind! I have a pretty good idea, thank you!"
(Grunts)
There's nothing more festive than fireworks!
(Gasp)
No!
(Whimpers)
Aah!
"Happy new year, everyone."
(Chuckles)
It's gonna blow!
Aah!
Aah!
(Grunts)
Jade!
"Yes, Jackie? Yes, Jackie?"
Explain?
"I didn't intend to involve you guys,"
but I arrived a lot later than I'd hoped.
Heh. Never tested uncle's spell.
Oh! And I thought one Jade gave me a headache.
But why did you come back here?
Duh! Isn't it obvious?
Future me is so mega-bad
that dragon-boy had to come back to the past
to rub me out while I'm just a squirt.
So I surfed the time waves here to protect myself
and his kick his scaly butt all the way back to the future.
Then why did drago leave without charbroiling you?
"Well, because..."
"Yeah, why did drago leave?"
Because he has bigger fish to fry.
How much bigger?
I didn't follow drago here.
Drago followed me
to keep me from putting the kibosh on the age of dragons.
Age of dragons?
I do not like the sound of that.
"Soon after I became section 13's head honcho,"
Sonny boy made it to the top of our most wanted list.
"Luckily, I convinced you and uncle"
to become section 13's official magic consultants.
You mean I never leave section 13?!
But even you and uncle couldn't prevent what happened next.
Junior dusted off an old spell of his dad's
"and conjured up an army of dragon minions,"
giving him more than enough muscle
to take over section 13.
I soon realized the only way
to save the future...
Was to change the past.
"It took some doing,"
but I escaped drago's troops.
But junior got wise to my plan
and hitched a ride on uncle's spell.
Whoa! So all this already happened?!
In the future?!
There is one thing you have not told us.
What exactly is drago trying to stop you from changing in the past?
He's trying to stop me from preventing
the resurrection of his father.
Shendu.
Uncle: Hmm.
Source of dark <i> chi</i> must lie here.
(Gasps) Ayah!
Dragon teeth!
More dark <i> chi?</i>
Hey! What do you know?
I'm off the scale.
Drago's racing to protect the magic dragon teeth
that'll revive his father.
I have to get to them first
and destroy them by midnight.
Why midnight?
The moment I left the future it was sunset--
the evening before Chinese new year.
The exact time you arrived here.
"And in the future, drago has already cast the dragon teeth spell."
"So if we don't destroy the teeth,"
shendu makes his big comeback
at the stroke of Chinese new year.
Big whoop.
Future Jackie and future uncle can beat future shendu.
They've done it before.
Jackie and uncle were taken prisoner
during the dragon raid on section 13.
"They're set to become shendu's ""welcome back"" snack..."
In 15 minutes.
(Both grunt)
The good news--
I know where the teeth are buried.
And the bad news?
"The can only be destroyed by magic,"
and there's no time for a talisman run.
No problem. Uncle's always packing hocus pocus.
We're too late!
Jackie: Uncle.
You don't think he's--
Jackie!
We must retrieve teeth!
Oh!
I imagine - grampy's referring to...
These little choppers!
"You're taking a risk hanging around here, aren't you, drago?"
Can't go anywhere without my ride.
What's he mean?
Time-travel spell.
Never leave the future without a return ticket.
"Dad's homecoming is just minutes away,"
and I really don't want to miss the appetizers.
"No deal, drago."
How about this...
"Hand me the spell,"
or the old guy goes bungee jumping
without a bungee.
(Snarls)
Have it your way!
Ayah!
(Grunts)
Stay here!
Oh!
Hyah!
Like old times.
"Sorry, scaly."
I'm not the sentimental type.
Hyah!
"Hurry, slowpoke!"
Uncle at end of his rope!
Ayah!
"Jackie, do not know what young dragon's up to,"
but teeth are very evil.
You do not know the half of it.
Unh!
Sometimes the future is now.
(Growls)
Apologies for my bad breath.
Hyah!
(Grunts)
You were supposed to stay put.
Tch. You know me better than that.
"My, what big teeth you have."
We're almost out of time.
(Imitates buzzer)
You lose.
Dad just got his wake-up call.
I live again!
No finer way - to emerge from a slumber
than to a nice hot cup of revenge.
"Say, are you sure he's shendu's kid?"
Who? The tooth fairy here?
"Tch. I mean, shendu had edge."
But this drago dude's more like--
a gecko with zits?
No!
No! Not again!
Aah!
Teeth do not disintegrate all by themselves.
Jade. Jade.
I shall destroy you now and forever!
"Told you a thousand times,"
magic must defeat magic.
Where did teeth go?
Dragon's firebreath is magic. Duh.
"Who is smarty-pants, good <i> chi</i> magic know-it-all"
who looks like Jade?
Ayah!
The dragons will rise again!
(Echoing) Again! Again! Again!
I really appreciate you saving me the hassle
of hauling drago's scaly tail
all the way back to the future.
"Aww, do you have to go back so soon?"
We haven't gone rollerblading
or--or mastered the pukinator at moose world!
"Been there, done that."
"Besides, don't you think--"
hanging around with myself is a little weird?
Yeah. We'd probably just sit around all day...
Both jades: Finishing each other's sentences?
One more thing.
Future uncle allows you to use his spells?
"Oh, uh, yeah. Total access."
You really mellow out as you age.
Tch. As if.
"Oh, almost forgot."
Pop quiz tomorrow in spelling.
Study chapter 8.
"Uh, Jade..."
"Thank you for saving our, uh, lives."
Be careful.
"And I just wanted you to know,"
I am proud of who you turned out to be.
I owe who I turned out to be
"to one person, uncle Jackie."
You. Duh.
"Hey, Jackie, how do you celebrate Chinese new year?"
We do a celebration that everybody wear red.
"Everything's--new socks, new shoes, new tee shirt. Everything is new."
I would book the hotel with all my staff together.
"I sing karaoke, play a little bit of games,"
and I give a red envelope.
"We have, like, a Chinese tradition of red envelopes."
"Put some money inside,"
"then I will say <i>""gong xi fa cai,""</i>"
"it's ""happy new year,"""
traditional Chinese new year.
You there! Laundry's that way!
Hyah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
"Fine work, team."
No one can stop the Chang gang...
Not even the j-team!
The coast is clear.
"Move quickly, tohru."
Jade must not find out captain black is assembling the j-team
or she will hatch another kooky-- Jade: Jackie!
I've hatched a mondo plan
to take down the j-team's arch-Nemesis
Bartholomew Chang.
Tell you all about it on the way to section 13--awp!
"The only plan, Jade, is for you to stay here with uncle."
Grrr! Jackie never listens!
Doesn't he realize I'm not only a member
but the brains behind the j-team?
Who is up for mah jong and mung beans? (Tiles clacking)
Maybe I can spell it out for Jackie...
With a little help from uncle's magic.
"While in prison, Chang managed to recruit an elite team,"
each possessing skills matching your own--
"an anti j-team, if you will."
Knock-offs are never as good as the originals.
"don't be so sure, viper."
Meet master thief Philip crain.
He's pulled heists on several international museums--
"the louvre, guggenheim, uffizi, Tate."
I hit each of those back when I was a thief.
Not on the same day.
Oh!
"El toro, meet your criminal counterpart--"
"Bob ""the bopper"" hathcock,"
pro-wrestling champ gone renegade.
His trademark move-- bopper's bash.
(Stupefied) Bopper's bash.
"(Covering) I mean, everyone knows American wrestling is fake."
"Black: Tohru, say hello to Helga sorensen."
She held the world's strongest woman title
before throwing it away for a career of crime.
How strong could a woman be?
Here's Helga lifting the world's strongest man.
Uhh!
(Gulps)
And my dance partner would be?
"""Little"" Tony chun. don't be fooled by the glasses."
He's the most feared martial artist on China's most-wanted list.
Heh heh! Guess he's not as cuddly as he looks.
Hmm...Lookee here. A seniority spell.
"""Gives it conjurer - authority over any subject."""
That means the j-team will finally listen to me!
I'll be their leader!
(Chanting)
"So, unc, what would you say if I commanded you"
to let me go to section 13 with Jackie?
"Uncle would say, go right ahead..."
Seniority rules.
If you want to make uncle angrier than rabid goat!
Jade?
(Gasps)
Paco.
"Oh, no, no, no, Jade."
The meeting is for the j-team only.
"Then, good thing I brought my membership card."
Chang has one weakness--
he will no doubt attempt to reacquire his fortune in Jade.
(Telephone rings)
Black here.
Bingo. Museum of natural history.
(Chanting)
"Ok, j-team, follow me!"
"Jade, stay with paco!"
Grrr! Lousy spell!
"Ha ha ha ha! Ah, green!"
The color of Jade!
"Really, Chang, you should consider taking up a legal pastime."
"Collecting baseball cards? Snow globes, maybe?"
"Warriors, attack!"
Uhh! Rarrr!
No. I will take the bopper.
Uhh! Uhh!
Grrr!
Pretty boy's mine.
"Uh, I cannot fight a woman."
This woman will make you scream like little girl.
Uhh! Uhh!
Uhh!
Ha ha ha! Jolly good.
"Where'd you pick up <i>that</i> accent--spies ""r"" us?"
The same place I picked up this little gem.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
You are quick!
"You mean, for a chubby guy?"
"No, no, no! Not what I meant!"
(Chuckles) It would seem the j-team
has finally met its match.
Uhh--huhh!
I'll hang your mask on my mantle!
El toro fuerte never removes his mask!
Uhh! Uhh!
Grrr!
Ooh! Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!
"I told you, I do not fight women."
Heeyah!
Oof!
"You're not the only one with the toys, handsome."
Ooh!
"Now, <i> he</i> is chubby."
Ehh! Uhh!
(All groaning)
That smarts.
Grrr!
Chang!
Uhh!
Ohh!
You've been made by Jade--
"er, brains behind the j-team, not the stone."
Jackie: Jade.
"What? You said, stay with paco."
<i>Como estas?</i>
"The results speak for themselves, Jackie!"
"Spell or no spell, the j-team needs to start including me!"
Uh...Spell?
"Uh, what spell?"
What's it matter? Didn't work.
(Gasps) Jade!
Huh?! Huh?!
"Or maybe it just took time to kick in,"
because I forgot the garlic! Duh!
(All gasp)
This can't be good.
"Oh, bad day!"
"Oh, boy."
Mommy.
(J-tots gasp)
<i>El toro</i> à <i> es El</i> <i>nio?</i>
This is <i> so</i> not the type of seniority spell I had in mind.
"Ha ha ha ha! The mighty j-team,"
victims of their own foolish magic!
"Now, if you brats don't mind..."
Go find a busy street to play in
while the grown-ups steal a fortune in Jade.
Jade!
I know! I am so grounded.
No! Kids against grown-ups!
Rrarr!
Waah! Aah!
(Soft punching)
Hyah!
Uhh! Ehh!
(Grunting)
Hyah!
Jalisco hairpull!
(Efforts)
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Acapulco ankle-lock!
(Efforts)
(The bopper chuckles)
(El toro sputters)
(Grunts and groans)
Uh...Friends?
I will break you.
(Crying)
(Wails) Ohh!
Heee--heee--heee--
"(singsong) - ""V"" my name is viper,"
"my boyfriend's name is Van,"
"he lives in Venezuela,"
sends me violets when he can!
Looks like it's up to me to stop Chang.
Heee-yup!
Ooh!
"(Grunting) Hey, watch it!"
(Efforting)
"Ta-ta, j-tots!"
"El toro, what should we do?"
"Not so fast, paco."
"I'm the biggest, so that means I'm in charge!"
"And I say, let's see what uncle thinks we should do."
Heh heh!
(Laughter and chatter)
"Sensei, sensei, look what Jade did to us!"
Tattletale.
"Aiyaaa! What have you done to us, Jade?"
"Whoa. Well, let's see."
"I've turned Jackie into a rough-houser,"
"tohru into a crybaby,"
"viper into a--blecch!-- Girly-girl,"
and El toro into--(Sniffs)
Sorry.
"Pee-yew! Paco, maybe you should change your hero."
El toro fuerte never removes his pants!
Hmm. It would seem Jade's spell
"has left our adult minds intact,"
but made us victim to childlike impulses!
"(Giggles) Uncle said,""butt!"""
"Jackie, this is no time to be childish!"
Jade is right! We must act our real ages!
We must find the stolen Jade
and return it to safety!
We must stop Mr. poopy-head!
"Nuh-uh, Jackie. You're too young to stop Chang."
And I'm too young to be an adult!
"Uncle, you have to do something!"
"Luckily, uncle possesses ancient fortune-teller"
which will reveal remedy to situation.
Pick color.
"Uh, blue."
B-l-u-e.
"Ooh, fortune teller reveals..."
You have big crush on Jade.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(Giggling)
¶ Jade and paco sittin' in a tree ¶
"ok, children, you leave aunt Jade no choice--"
it's naptime!
No siesta!
I'm not tired.
(Yawns)
First one asleep gets a cookie when they wake up.
"Uh-uh. Not you, paco."
I cannot win the cookie?
"Uncle, listen."
If you don't find a reversal spell
"to return the j-team to normal fast,"
the world's greatest crime fighting team is kaput!
"Oh, oh! Any leads on Chang?"
Intelligence indicates Chang owns a cargo ship
docked at port 17.
No doubt he'll try and move the stolen goods out of the country.
Not with the j-team waiting.
"Jackie, you sound all...Chipmunky."
"Captain black, is the section 13 mainframe running?"
Uh...Of course.
Then why don't you catch it!
(Laughter)
Let's move!
But Jade said we're not allowed to stop...You know...
Mr. poopy-head?
"Well, Jade did not say we couldn't stop..."
Mr. doody-face.
Just what I like to hear...Nothing.
Huh?!
"""Dear Jade, how are you? I am fine."
"""We went to port 17 to stop Chang."
"""When I get back, let's have a <i> tea party?</i>"
"Best friends forever. Viper?!"""
Unh! They pulled a Jade.
I better pull a Jackie before it's too late.
"¶ I have ants in my pants, and I must dance ¶"
"uncle, do your homework"
or...No dessert!
"Paco, make sure he finds that spell."
We can't let them steal all the pretty Jade.
(Gulp) But we're no match for them.
You are <i> El pollo.</i>
(Imitating chicken)
"No. Tohru may be a crybaby,"
but he is right.
(Whimpering)
We need to hatch a plan.
A really mondo plan!
And final ingredient...
Garlic.
Then this will turn the j-team back to normal?
No...
But it will make you donkey boy! Ha ha ha ha!
"Quickly now,"
load the Jade onto the ship
so we can--
(horn honks)
Move your leg.
You're stepping on the brake.
"Oh, oh, tun left now. Now right!"
Have we lost them?
Uhh--unh!
"So, you want to play?"
Make the j-tots wish they were never born.
(All gasp)
"Jade: Back off, you bullies!"
Hyah!
Look out! It's a siamese flesh-eating lizard!
Aah!
Aah!
"Oop, don't forget..."
(Chanting rapidly)
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Yes! Garlic's the charm.
"Warriors, attack!"
(All yelling)
"Ok, Jackie, care to explain the helium voice"
and the crank calls?
Paco?
"<i>Que pasa,</i> <i>seor b</i> lack?"
Hot cha!
"Whoa, Nellie!"
Never mind donkey boy.
Uncle has devised reversal spell.
Paco: You must take it to the j-team.
<i>Seor u</i> ncle is too young to drive.
But first we must stop for ice cream!
Now?
You want uncle to cast reversal spell
on j-team? Yes?
Then you will <i> stop</i> à <i> for ice cream!</i>
Huh! Huh!
"Sorry, Chang, I only pick on villains my own size."
Then the kid gloves are off.
Whoa! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
"Let's dance, pipsqueak!"
Hyah! Hyah!
Rrrrrrr... Rrrrrrr...
Unh! Ow! Unh! Ow!
(Both crying)
Tag! You're it!
"Hey, we're not playing tag."
Then how about peek-a-boo?!
"Patty cake, Patty cake, Baker's man,"
bake me a cake like Jackie chan!
Bopper's bash!
<i>Puebla</i> poo-plex.
(Sniffs)
Eww...Stinkies!
No fair!
Wedginator!
"Ooh! Ok, ok!"
Uncle!
That is my name. Do not wear it out.
Pbbbbbbbt!
(Chanting rapidly)
Yay!
Ahem. Ahem.
"Uh, many thanks, <i> sensei.</i>"
"Good work, j-team."
You will need a note from your parents
to get this back.
Rrrrrrr!
Yeah. You are so grounded!
Chang is not the only one
"who is grounded, Jade."
"I know you are, but what am I?"
"Hey, Jackie, what's your favorite museum in the world?"
There's only 2 museums I really remember.
One is in Paris. There's so many art.
I see Mona Lisa.
"But there's one museum, very interesting."
"The Egypt, uh...Museum."
A lot of mummies.
A lot of different interesting things.
"Really, totally different than Paris museum."
Previously - on <i> Jackie chan adventures...</i>
Prepare for battle.
Daolon wong!
Enforcers: Argh!
Aah! Unh!
Ugh! Guh!
Busted.
"Quickly, Jackie."
We must find deja vu stone before daolon wong.
Can you believe dark wizard was released from jail
for good behavior?
I do not think the justice system is prepared
"to comprehend crimes of magic, uncle."
(Gasps)
Blowfish indicates stone is near.
What is so important about a deja vu stone?
Whosoever possesses stone
can transport himself into his own past
"and back again,"
simply by willing it.
Daolon wong could revisit all his past defeats.
(Grunting)
Ow!
Why would anyone want to be defeated
over and over again? Ow!
You are slow on uptake!
Daolon wong is now powerless.
He would change past outcomes
to regain his magic.
(Footsteps)
(Gasps)
The dark chi master himself?
T'ch! The sly niece-meister herself!
(Gasps) The deja vu stone!
Jade!
"Come on, Jackie."
"I've helped save the day 72 times,"
"the world half a dozen times,"
and your butt more times than I care to count.
And you have made a mess of things
more times than I care to count.
But I always clean up after myself.
"Just admit it, Jackie. You need me. Hey!"
Ha!
All: Daolon wong?!
Many thanks for the memories.
Hyah!
Jackie?
(Echoing) Jackie?
"Uh, where'd they go?"
Somewhere in time.
We must locate their whereabouts.
How? History's a big place.
Deja vu stone allows one to travel
only into their own past.
Jade: Whoa! Mondo rewind.
But which Jackie is the one we're looking for?
"According to uncle's locator spell,"
that one.
Funny. I have the strangest feeling
I have been here before.
Chan! The tal--
"oh, tohru! Am I glad to see you!"
"One moment, I was in the far east"
confronting daolon wong.
"The next, I am here in--"
yargh! Waah!
Grr!
Yargh! Waah!
"Tohru, what has gotten into you?"
It is as if you are--
the talisman.
Working for the dark hand.
The deja vu stone! I have been here before!
Aah! Yargh!
And I do not think I enjoyed myself!
Whoa!
Grr!
Yargh!
I do not see deja vu stone.
Daolon wong must have it.
So Jackie's stuck there?
And why isn't wong with him?
Perhaps because the ex-wizard
was randomly hurled
somewhere into his own past.
We must help Jackie with portal magic.
Unh!
Heh! I knew you were going to do that.
I'm sorry to leave a future friend
"in the lurch, tohru."
Chan!
Both: Aah!
Ooh!
"Hey, didn't Jackie get out of this scrape"
in one piece the first time around?
"When one revisits past,"
one risks changing its outcome.
Ooh! That's is not
what happened the first time.
But this happens next.
Unh! Waah!
"You did it, unc!"
So where's Jackie?
"Portal magic good for quick escape,"
but only way back to present time
is through the power of the deja vu stone.
(Gasps)
Portal magic will allow Jackie
"to visit more memories,"
where he will hopefully locate daolon wong
and the stone.
How did I--
where am I?
"Oh, no!"
Oh! This is one memory
I have been trying to forget!
"I outran the train before,"
I will do it again!
Unh! Aah!
I must be out of shape!
"Uncle, when you said the past could change,"
did you mean--
"if Jackie makes wrong move,"
he may never come out alive.
Yaah!
Yaah!
Aah!
Whew! The past sure is tense.
Humph! Jackie must learn to be more careful.
"So, where to next?"
"Where Jackie stops, nobody knows."
Ugh! Aah!
A broken leg?!
But I did not even hit the ground!
"Jackie! Oh, Jade!"
Do you see the mess you have gotten me into?
"Gee, Jackie, I already admitted"
it was totally my fault
you slipped on my gnomekop action figure
and busted your leg.
"No, not that!"
If you hadn't gotten in the way
"and allowed daolon wong to take the deja vu stone,"
I wouldn't be lost in time.
Huh?
Ugh! Never mind.
You are the past Jade.
You wouldn't know about that.
"Uncle, do you think Jackie's right?"
Did I really mess things up?
"Humph! Nonsense, Jade."
Jackie needs to watch where he's walking.
Not the broken leg! The deja vu thing!
I stood there like a dummy
while wong snaked it from me.
It's all my fault Jackie's stuck in rerun-ville.
Ohh!
Jackie!
Aah!
Gee. Couldn't you send Jackie
"to a less life-threatening roller coaster,"
like the pukinator at moose world?
Uncle has no control over portal direction.
It is process of trial and error.
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Mostly error.
Aah!
Whoa!
After him!
"Oh, magic hole, please open up!"
"I do not know where you come from,"
but I am ready for you to take me away from here!
Whoa! Look at Jackie go!
Hmm. Guess he does do ok without my help.
Aah!
"I'll give Jackie a 9.2 for thinking on his feet,"
but we really work much better as a team.
"Jackie: No! No, Jade!"
Do not get on that plane!
Heh heh! See? Teamwork!
You never listen.
Not this. Anything but this!
(Huffing and puffing)
Aah!
Ohh!
"Ok, things can't get any worse for Jackie."
Unh!
Turning into statue is better?
Heh heh. - Depends who you ask.
"Jackie: Quick, Jade! The antidote!"
No!
"T'ch, you'd think I woulda got it right"
the second time around.
Your past self does not know then
"what you know now, Jade."
Maybe-- urk--
this is preferable to-- ohh--
being cursed to relive all the-- uhh--
worst moments of my life!
Whew!
Jackie was very close to becoming pigeon roost.
"Uh, let's hope he doesn't become"
dragon chow.
Uhh!
"Of all the villains, I had to bump into shendu?"
Uhh!
Cute.
Bwaaa!
(Gasps) Invisibility.
Bwaaa!
"Monkey see, monkey do!"
Aah!
"Ooh! If memory serves,"
here's where I make a star entrance
and save the day.
The strength talisman. Good one.
"I know, Jade-- bwaaa!"
Jade?! How did you--
your hands!
"I get it, that must be"
some uncle magic and-- (Gasps)
Bwaaa!
Ugh! I blew it again!
I distracted Jackie just like I did today.
Does twice make a pattern?
"Oh, no!"
Valmont has the dragon talisman power!
"Ah, now things are getting interesting."
Uhh!
Uhh!
Ohh!
Respect your elders.
Ohh!
Uncle! How do you spray for bugs?
Ow!
One more thing...
Ha ha!
Who else wants a piece of uncle?
"Ok, but have you saved Jackie's butt"
72 times?
I'm the one who always gets him out of binds.
Uhh! Uhh!
Do not waste your strength.
Someone will come.
This is a job for supermoose!
¶ Dope Dee dope Dee Doe ¶
guh-huh.
"Heh. Well, almost always."
Could it be?
Jackie: A view?
"In a nice, cozy, danger-free hotel?"
A happy memory?
Wha? Bwaaa!
"Jackie, don't worry. I can explain everything."
(Creaking)
"(Together) Heh. Hi, Jackie."
So I'm quite the rascal.
But it's not like I'm evil or anything.
Jackie: Jade?
I couldn't help it. I was possessed!
Did uncle ask you to tattoo demon face
onto your leg?
No?
You do not see uncle walking around
"being evil, do you?"
Uh...Unc?
(Snarling)
"Uncle could not help it,"
was victim of chi vampire.
"Oh, yeah, - and I had a piece of your mind."
You must keep vampire uncle busy
while I learn how to subdue him!
My master will feast upon your <i> chi!</i>
"Please, learn fast!"
"And while you're at it,"
learn a way to send me back to the future
where I belong!
"Uncle, isn't there some way to,"
"I don't know, make the portal magic work faster?"
"There is one way,"
but it is very risky.
Riskier than an up-close look
at po Kong - the mountain demon's tonsils?
Megadose of garlic.
Whew! Too close.
(Gasps) It is as I feared!
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
"What's happening, uncle?"
"Garlic has accelerated portal magic,"
causing Jackie to bounce against walls of time.
Jackie: Bad day! Bad day!
Jackie: Bad day! Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
One more thing. One more thing.
One more thing. One more thing.
One more thing. One more thing. One more thing.
Duh. T'ch.
Duh. T'ch.
Duh. T'ch.
Duh. T'ch. Duh.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"If this doesn't end soon,"
I'm gonna hurl.
Uncle becoming very dizzy.
Aah!
Ohh. Where'd he go this time?
Ah!
Brrr!
"We have found daolon wong,"
but not deja vu stone.
Their struggle must have caused
stone itself to be randomly lost
in one of their past experiences.
Uncle!
Aah! Uhh!
Huh?
Uh...Hello.
Uhh!
Hmm.
Portal magic?
See the oinker at 12 o'clock?
"Yes, that is very nice, Jade,"
but I am really not supposed to be here--
oh.
There!
Check it out! I helped!
The deja vu stone.
"Uh, yeah, whatever. Aren't we looking for the pig talisman?"
Uhh!
Tohru!
Many thanks
for leading us to the prize.
You are not welcome.
You!
Why so afraid? He is an old man.
Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Ohh!
Uhh!
That will teach foolish tohru
to mess with uncle when he is powered
by immortality talisman.
Oh. Do not tell faithful apprentice
uncle said that.
"Come on, Jackie! Grab the stone"
and will yourself back here.
Hyah!
"Since you seem to have things well in hand, uncle,"
I will take my leave. (Gasps)
The stone is mine!
Who is that?!
And what is with this stone
you all keep jabbering about?
Whoa. Wong snaked his way in!
Aiyaaa!
(Breathing hard)
Take me back to the beginning!
"So here we are,"
back in the old fool's trash heap.
That is old fool's rare trash heap to you!
Wait a sec.
Jackie went to the wrong beginning:
The first time we met!
Wait. This can't be right.
Where are uncle and--
give me that!
Ohh!
Jade.
Jackie is right. I do get in his way.
"You're Jackie chan, the archeologist?"
I bet you are looking for the shield
I brought back from Bavaria.
We're looking for-- how'd you know?
He has it.
Chan is lying!
Do you not recognize your master?
The only master we have is big v.
Chow: And he's gonna wanna hear all about
where you stashed the shield.
"Way to rewrite history, Jackie."
Did they buy anything? No.
You are terrible salesman!
Who are you calling?
Jade's parents. She must return to Hong Kong.
But she just arrived!
What? No way!
Who's gonna help save the day?
The world? Jackie's butt?!
"Uncle, you must trust me."
"It will be better for Jade,"
"for us, if she does not stay."
"No, Jackie. Hang up the phone."
You need me.
Hyah!
Jade is in the house.
"I got your back, Jackie."
Man: Hello?
"Uh, sorry. Wrong number."
"Uncle: Jackie,"
"next time you make crank call,"
phone local.
Living with you guys is gonna rock!
(Sighs) You have no idea yet just how much.
(Gasps) You speak English!
"Now, return me to the present."
Jackie! You do need me!
"Jade, how did you know?"
Where did Jackie go?
I'm glad you decided to keep me around.
"Let us just say, I realized that perhaps"
you have saved me a time or two.
T'ch. Try 72.
"Hey, Jackie, do you believe fortune tellers can predict the future?"
"Uh, actually, I don't believe."
I only believe myself.
"Work hard, learn more, helping people,"
"always give people second chance,"
then you have a good future.
That's what I believe.
Previously...
I am the one and only king of the shadowkhan.
But tarakudo's rein came to an end
when the spirits of his generals
were trapped within masks.
"9 oni generals,"
9 masks.
9 different tribes of shadowkhan?
We must remove demon mask from host
in order to defeat shadowkhan!
Unh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Getting warm. Warmer.
Boiling.
Cooked.
"This seems way too easy, doesn't it?"
Easy?! We are at the bottom of the ocean!
"Yeah, but this is the last oni mask."
Where are tarakudo and his goons?
Where's the ultimate good-versus-evil battle royale?
"I, for one, am not complaining."
So our quest is complete?
"As you have researched, tohru."
"9 masks, 9 demon generals."
Which means we won't be needing
these Hana fuda cards anymore.
(Gasps)
Then why does tohru have the willies?
(Gasps)
The masks... Are destroyed?
"That's a good thing, right?"
Oni.
How is this happening?
Uncle not sure.
But it must be your fault!
"Many thanks for our freedom, chan."
Now it is time to surrender yours.
Aah!
Eat dragon heat!
Ungh!
"Go, go, go!"
Summon the dark ones.
Shadowkhan's greatest hits.
Aah!
Hyah!
Whoa. New guy.
Ninja number 9.
What?!
(Pounding on door)
"Captain black, we have a breach."
Alert your agents and--
magic must defeat magic.
We must do research now.
"Whoa, Nelly."
"Uh, think we can take 'em?"
Uncle: Dark forces are not attacking?
The combined power of the 9 masks
can summon enough shadowkhan
to engulf the earth in eternal darkness.
(Chanting in Chinese)
Chi spell will protect shop from dark magic.
"<i>Sensei,</i> none of this makes sense."
I have reviewed every inch of the legend.
Every inch?
Uh...It is a warning.
"""Never conjoin the 9 masks in one location."""
Hence the scattering across the earth part.
Aiyah. The darkness is already taking hold.
All good magic will soon fade to nothing.
(Pounding on door)
(Gulps)
Something wants in.
El toro! Viper!
What are you doing here?
"Well, it looked as if the world was coming to an end..."
And we figured you four
might know a thing or two about it.
"So, we're supposed to put a kibosh"
on a vast army of ninja magic how?
We must gather the spell ingredients
to defeat their leaders.
"Japanese steel, silk--ow!"
Did you not see the 9 masks
destroyed before your very eyes?
The spells which originally
defeated the demons will no longer work
because the masks which imprison them
no longer exist.
"Our only hope is to defeat tarakudo,"
"lord of all oni, king of all shadowkhan."
But how do you beat a big floating spirit-head?
Mm-mmm-mm.
(Cell phone rings)
"Captain black, are you all right?"
"Been better, Jackie."
We're operating from a mobile unit.
The oni seized headquarters.
Satellite surveillance indicates
"they're on their way out of town in teams of 2,"
"heading north, south, east, and west."
No doubt to stake their claims
to the 4 corners of the globe.
Unless the j-team stops them before they get that far.
"Be careful, my friend."
Battle the oni?
Without the special spell ingredients?
"The fight may be more fair than you think, tohru."
The oni generals will be unable to summon their ninjas
without disrupting the shroud of darkness.
"Besides, t, we're still packin' t-power."
Snake has my name on it.
I call dragon!
Dog and rat?
Oh! You're gonna hog all the cool ones!
"Jade, you will remain here."
What?! No way!
"Jade, please."
I could not live with myself
if something happened to you.
Aw.
Uncle: Today... Dark forces must pay!
This bridge is closed.
(Growling)
"Watch out, boys."
Snake in the grass.
(Moans)
<i>Sensei?</i>
The willies?
Ha ha. Pardon me. - I dropped something.
Antler action!
"Oh, yeah! I'm bad! You're sad!"
Supermoose?
Jackie!
"Jade, you were supposed to be--"
I decided I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to you.
Supermoose: Can you feel the love?
"Well, can ya, punk?"
Many thanks for removing
"that ghastly onion spell, general ikazuki."
Section 13 - is far more inviting
with you running things.
And our shadow armies
"are advancing as we speak, master tarakudo."
Within hours this planet
will succumb to the forces of--
ooh.
The forces of ooh?
I'm picking up some...Interference.
Aah!
Ya-ha!
Surf's up.
What?
Hmm.
You're quite a catch.
Yah!
Ah-choo!
Why did you choose kittens?
Uncle is allergic!
All aboard!
Aiyah!
Ungh!
Uppercut!
Right hook!
Left antler!
(Jade cheers)
Getting...Weak.
Oh!
(Chuckles)
"Nice try, gang."
It would seem humankind's last line of defense...
Has reached the end of their line.
Allowing our generals to resume their progress
toward making this world...
A much darker place.
(Groaning with strain)
"Gel or no gel, my hair won't cut it."
Anyone have a Bobby pin? Credit card?
Hana fuda card.
Whoa.
It cannot be.
A tenth mask.
Jade: Look who it is.
Tohru: Tarakudo.
But tohru's research indicated there are only 9.
"Maybe tohru messed up that part, too."
Each mask was created by ancient good chi wizards
to imprison the demon generals within them.
What if a tenth mask were forged?
Intended to trap tarakudo
like the others.
But the king of the shadowkhan got to it first.
"If a tenth mask exists,"
the cards will tell us where to find it.
(Gasps)
"Uncle, what is it?"
Tarakudo concealed the mask
in the one place no mortal would dare enter:
The shadow realm.
But how do we get out of here?
And into there?
We need not leave this cell.
All: Huh?
All shadows lead to the shadow realm.
All that we need is dark magic
to take us there.
Easy!
"As any ex-queen of the shadowkhan can tell you,"
wearing the sign of tarakudo
gives you control over ninjas.
It's tattoo time.
"No, Jade. It is far too dangerous,"
even if you have done it before.
I volunteer tohru.
Wha--wha? M-m-me?
(Spits)
There is no better time to face your fear of oni
than when fate of world is at stake.
"Now, enter shadow realm quickly!"
How do I--
"call upon darkness, which now lies within you."
(Groans)
"You're the boss, t."
Just tell 'em what to do.
"Um, ahem."
Take me to--(Gulps) The shadow realm.
Aah!
One more thing!
Uncle never leave shop without magic socks.
He cannot be serious.
Be thankful he's not talking underwear.
This thread will be your lifeline to our realm.
Tug firmly when you find mask.
(Moans)
Whoa!
Tohru had better find mask
before we run out of sock...
And before evil within tattoo
consumes his very being.
Whoa!
Tohru has mask.
Reel him in quickly!
"Come on back, t."
Tohru!
You did it!
You have located the tenth mask.
(Roars)
Tarakudo!
Aiyah! We have lost tohru to dark forces!
Who calls my na-- (Gasps)
I shall destroy you all!
Aiyah!
All: Aah!
(Groans)
No one touches my face.
Ikazuki!
Argh!
Oof!
Ooh!
Oni cream sandwich.
Jackie!
Uncle needs ingredient to complete spell!
What ingredient?!
Hair of Japanese samurai!
Heh heh heh.
A shame that ancient Japan is ancient history.
Argh!
Tohru's Japanese. Think he has any samurai blood?
One way to find out.
"Sorry, big guy."
Argh!
Just a little off the topknot.
"Oh, no, you don't!"
"Going up, handsome."
(Chanting in Chinese)
Whoa!
Whoa. Tarakudo has legs.
"Did your spell do this, uncle?"
Of course.
It is the only way for mask to stick to face.
Over my demon body.
"No mental powers, tarakudo?"
It is about time you fought fair.
Aah! Whoa!
Hyah!
Oh!
"Now, Mr. chan, if you'll hand over the mask,"
I'll take care to dispose of it once and for all.
Jade: Tarakudo?
Heads up!
No!
Noooooo!
Jackie.
Ohh.
10 demons and a gajillion ninjas
in one teeny tiny mask?
Cozy.
So...There are no more masks?
Does tohru have willies? No?
Then there are no more masks.
Thanks to the winning team.
"Hey, Jackie, do you ever go fishing?"
"Very, very little chance."
"I never go, like, call my friends,"
"""let's go fish today. Holiday."" Never."
"Only when we are - on the filming, on the boat."
Then I fish a little bit.
I'm not this kind of person.
"First, I hate water. Why?"
Because I get seasick when I'm on the boat.
"Besides, I don't like to spend so much time to waiting, waiting."
I'd rather...Training.
"But I do go, but little time."
"Jackie: And that is ursa major,"
"more commonly referred to as ""the big dipper."""
Jade: Incoming!
(Jade burps)
"Jackie: Ohh, Jade!"
(Tohru giggles)
"Jackie: Please, tohru, do not encourage her."
(Jade burps) (Tohru stifles giggles)
Uncle: Ai yah!
Jade's belly breezes not important.
Alignment of stars reveal that now
is very good time for very bad chi.
(Explosion)
Drago: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
No prison can hold the son of shendu.
"Captain black: Give it up, drago."
You're not going anywhere...
And neither is your dragon daddy.
Drago: Now who said anything about busting out that old gecko?
I'm going solo.
Men: Aaah! Get away!
(Jackie gasps)
Jackie: Drago has black pinned down.
I need to create a diversion.
"Jade: Yo, hothead!"
Remember me?
"There are no ""get out of jail free"" cards"
as long as j-girl's still got game.
Black: Drago!
Jade: Told ya.
Jackie: Jade!
"Drago: Hello, payback."
Jackie: Jade!
Jackie: Jade!
"Jade: You Tarzan, me Jade."
(Agents screaming)
(Drago growls)
"Drago: Mess with a dragon,"
you're gonna get burned!
"Jackie: If drago does not want to help shendu,"
then what does he want?
Jade: Hello! Freedom!
Tohru: Perhaps the answer lies
"in the alignment of the ""bad chi"" stars."
"Uncle: Stars, yes,"
but also in uncle's bookshelf.
"Come, tohru, we must do research!"
Black: I have agents combing the bay area.
Drago won't get far.
Jade: That overgrown handbag doesn't stand a chance!
"So, cb, what's my assignment?"
Jackie: The only assignments
you will be getting today are at school.
Jade: Ohhh!
(Kids burping)
(Jade burps loud and long)
Kids: All right!
Ms. hardman: Ahem.
Jade: Heh heh. Pardon me?
Black: Looks like t-Rex Jr.'s catching a catnap.
Jackie: I believe he is in a trance.
(Cell phone rings)
(Drago growls)
Black: Jackie.
(Ring)
"Jackie: Hold, please. Aaah!"
(Phone rings)
Jackie: Hello?
"Yes, Ms. hardman, this is Jade's uncle."
Chow: Ready?
Finn: Let's do it.
Finn: Closing time. Everybody out.
(Children groaning)
Man: don't forget to wash your hands.
"Woman: Let's go, honey. It's time to go home."
Second man: don't give me that.
Finn: Eww! I hate my job.
Ratso: Wanna switch?
Chow: Come on! Show's over. Amscray! Get outta here!
"Drago: I am drago, the son of shendu!"
Serve me well now and be at my side
when I rule the world.
"Chow: Uh, sorry, kid,"
but your old man kinda burned us.
Ratso: Yeah. And I got the scars to prove it.
Drago: You're turning me down?
"Finn: Look, all that world domination stuff"
just don't pay the rent.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Whaaah!
Drago: Who's next?
"Chow: Hey, money isn't everything."
Drago: Agreed.
Now it's time for your makeovers.
Chow: Makeovers?
Ratso: But I have sensitive skin.
All: Yeoww! Aaaah!
Finn: Smokin'!
(Puffs)
Chow: Sweet.
"Ratso: Hey, I can make grilled cheese sandwiches whenever I want!"
"Finn: So, what should we steal first?"
Chow: Cash? Ratso: Jewels?
Drago: A fan.
"Ratso: Oh, boy."
Jade: But what about freedom of expression?
"This is America, you know."
"Jackie: Jade, this has nothing to do with free speech"
and everything to do with self-control.
"Promise me, no more burping."
Jade: Fine.
I'll just explode from all the built-up gas
before I'm 16.
(Truck brakes screech)
Black: Drago's been spotted.
"Jackie: Jade, stay here."
Jade: Seriously... Jackie: Aaah!
Jade: don't you ever get tired of saying that?
Drago: The fan's here somewhere.
I can feel it.
Clear the place out.
Finn: Thought you'd never ask.
(People screaming)
Finn: Stee-rike!
I see a bus pass in your future.
Unhh!
Black: And I see prison stripes in yours.
Jade: No way!
The enforcers are now drago's fire flunkies?
Chow: Jackie chan!
"Long time, no rumble."
Jackie: I will draw their fire.
You run back to captain black's truck.
Jade: But Jackie--
Jackie: And no arguments.
(Jade groans)
"Chow: Come out, come out wherever you are."
Jackie: Hyah!
Chow: Aaah!
Ratso: Yeowww!
"Black: Claws up, drago."
Drago: With pleasure.
Black: Aaah! Uhh!
Jackie: Unhh!
Jade: Hello! Uncle Jackie?
"Drago: Say good-bye, Jade."
(Jade gasps)
Jade: Whoa!
Black: I'll grab Jade. You find drago.
(Air vent whooshes)
Drago: The fan of the immortals.
(Doorbell rings)
Drago: Unhh!
(Drago exhales)
Drago: Looks like we'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.
Black: You boys need to cool off.
Chow: Aaah! Ratso: Whoa!
"Finn: Get ready to fry, small fry."
Finn: (Groans) Whoaaah!
Oof!
Jade: May I also interest you in new car scent?
Jade: Hyaaah!
Drago: Unhh!
Black: You two all right?
(Rumbling)
(Drago grunts)
Drago: (Groans)
Get the fan!
Chow: ¶ ah ha ha-ha! ¶
Jackie: All of this for a fan?
Uncle: Not a fan.
The fan of the immortals.
Dragon teeny-bopper wants to absorb
its powerful wind demon chi.
"Jackie: But uncle,"
we already defeated the other 7 demons.
Ow! Ow!
Uncle: Clean wax out of ears.
"Uncle said ""demon chi,"""
not demons themselves.
"Tohru, explain research."
Tohru: Thousands of years ago...
An immortal warrior used a magical fan
"to defeat xiao fung, the wind demon."
But traces of the wind demon's power
"are rumored to have clung to the fan throughout the centuries,"
until--
Jackie: They were again activated
"by the alignment of the ""bad chi"" stars"
uncle discovered last night.
Jade: So drago busted out of section 13
"in order to double up on demon powers,"
fire <i> and</i> wind.
Uncle: By stealing fan of the immortals.
Why did you let demon take immortal fan?!
"Jackie: Ohh...Bad day, bad day, bad day."
Finn: This dump is home sweet home?
Drago: This is useless!
The wind demon chi has already been drained from it.
"Chow: And that's a bad thing, right?"
All: Yeeowww!
"Finn: Uh, we're gonna let you have"
a little alone time now.
Jade: Come on!
Let's get outta here and stomp those fire thugs!
Uncle: Do not rush uncle!
Demon chi removal spell very tricky.
"Jade, make yourself useful."
Get <i> ancient Tome</i> à <i> of warts and toads</i>
from bookcase.
(Stomach grumbles)
(Burps)
Jade: Aaaaaah!
(Crash)
Jackie: Jade?
(Jade whistling)
Ms. hardman: And early sailing ships
were also affected by the doldrums.
(Children giggle)
Ms. hardman: The doldrums are an area of low pressure
with almost no wind at all.
(Children laughing)
(Jade burps loudly)
"Ms. hardman: That's it, young lady!"
I am sending you straight to the...
Nurse's office.
Uncle: Uncle almost finished with wind demon chi removal spell.
One more thing--
why has drago not yet used wind demon powers?
(Cell phone rings)
Jackie: Hello?
"Yes, this is Jade's uncle."
Oh.
I will be right there.
The school says Jade is not feeling well.
I wonder if it has anything to do
with all those sodas she drinks?
Chow: This guy's worse than his old man.
Ratso: But he looks so peaceful.
"Finn: Yeah. So do cobras,"
right before they strike.
Drago: Raaah!
We're going to school.
(School bell rings)
(Children laugh and shout)
Jade: So I'm a little gassy today.
Blame the cafeteria burritos.
Aaah!
Jade: What's wrong with me?!
(Door creaks open)
"Drago: You're short, green,"
and a real pain in the butt.
So stick out your chi
"and say ""aaah."""
Jade: I'm warning you...
I don't feel so--
(stomach rumbles)
(Through rushing wind) Good!
All: Aaah! Unhh!
(Shudders)
Jackie: Jade?
Jade: Uncle Jackie!
(Jackie gasps)
Jackie:What's happened to you? Jade:What happened to me?
"Jackie: Jade, tell me you've been fooling around"
with uncle's spells.
"Jade: No, I swear!"
I just looked up and bam! Toad girl!
Jackie: It's all right. Uncle will know what to do.
Jade: But what if I'm a gross-out forever?
"Just sitting around, eating flies,"
waiting to croak.
Jackie: Time to leave before your demon prince arrives.
Drago: I'm gonna need to see your hall pass.
"Jackie: Pardon us, coming through! Got to run!"
(Drago groans)
Drago: Do something!
Jackie: Aah!
Hop on!
Sorry.
Aah! Aah aah! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Hot! Hot!
Drago: Cut off their exit!
(Jackie sighs in relief)
Jade: How did this happen to me?
Jackie: You must have absorbed the wind demon chi
from the immortal fan at the car wash.
Jade: Me? The wind demon chi?
"So, why am I running?"
"Jackie: Jade, the longer the demon chi remains inside you,"
the harder it will be for uncle to remove.
"Uncle: Hello, uncles antiques."
"Jackie: Uncle, drago and the enforcers"
are at Jade's school and--yaah!
Uncle: Jackie? Jackie?!
"Drago: Sorry, your minutes have expired."
"And now, so will you."
Jade: Fire! (Strong burp)
Drago: Aaah!
Jade: Excuse me...Not!
(Jackie coughs)
"Jackie: Uh, I could use a little fresh air."
Jade: Heh heh. Follow me.
(Flames sizzling)
Finn: Keep chan busy.
"Jackie: Jade, run!"
"Uh, hop--whatever!"
Finn: Drago wants the wind demon chi.
Jade: Isn't he enough of a blowhard already?
"(Burps, wind rushing)"
Finn: That is rank!
Aaaah!
Finn and chow: Unhh!
"Jade: Hmm, it's not so bad being green."
Ratso: Yeah?
Unhh!
Jade: Yes! (Gasps)
Uncle Jackie!
Drago: Today's lesson--
never stand downwind from a wind demon.
Jade: (Grunts) Get your claws off me!
Jackie: Hyah!
"Jade: Hey, I'm me!"
"Jackie: But if you're back to normal,"
that means...
Drago: You're all toast!
(Tohru and uncle chanting spell)
Drago: No!
Uncle and tohru: Whoa!
Jackie: Uncle!
Drago still has his fire demon chi!
Uncle: Removal spell was for <i> wind</i> demon chi
not <i> fire</i> demon chi.
Pay attention!
"Finn: Uh, little help here, boss."
Drago: Weak and worthless.
You're fired!
All: Aaaaah!
"Ratso: Uh, anybody going by the petting zoo?"
Drago: This isn't over.
"Jade: Oh, yeah? Then why are you running away?"
Uncle: Because drago knows 6 other demons
were defeated by immortal warriors in ancient times.
Tohru: Which means 6 more immortal relics
will have traces of demon chi on them...
Jackie: And drago will be seeking them all.
Jade: So we'll just have to find them first.
Uncle: Or entire world
will be under drago's claw.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, in your own words, what is chi?"
Jackie chan: Everything is about chi.
It's about...(Exhales)
You're doing this kind of--
(whooping)
"Jackie chan: Uncle, how does this,"
"um, device locate the scattered demon chi?"
Uncle chan: Ancient Chinese compass detects energy imbalance.
"When demon chi is activated, compass picks up frequency,"
leading us directly to the immortal object.
Tohru: A reversal spell
will then draw the bad chi out
of the immortal object and into the containment jar.
Uncle: Uncle getting to that!
A reversal spell will then draw bad chi out
of the immortal object and into the containment jar.
"Jade chan: So, it's your basic demon chi-o-matic."
Shipping and handling not included.
"TV host: On the next <i>international island</i> <i>challenge,</i>"
2 more families will meet on the polynesian island of boru
to face off in a grueling test
of mental and physical endurance.
Which family is tough enough to be called the best
and take home a prize package including 2 all-terrain vehicles
and a flat-screen TV with DVD and surround sound?
Jade: No way.
Host: Which family will avoid elimination
by earning this amnesty idol?
"Jade: Well, that's a first."
A demon chi with it's own series.
Uncle: Aiyaa! Bai tza.
Water demon chi has been activated.
Jade: And that's her... Zucchini?
Tohru: It's a gourd-- the immortal relic
used to defeat her thousands of years ago.
Jackie: And now it's on national television.
We must get to that island before drago.
"Jade: Boru, here we come."
I am so gonna kick butt in that game.
"¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh ¶"
"Jackie: We're not going to boru to compete, Jade."
You will stay here with tohru.
"Jade: Oh, come on, uncle Jackie!"
I've seen every single episode of <i> international</i> à <i> island challenge.</i>
You gotta take me!
Jackie: Jade...
"Jade: I know, I know."
I always have to play the home version.
"Drago: Ah, henchmen, waste of time."
Excess baggage killing my mojo.
Solo is the way to go.
Bai tza.
Ratso! Finn! Chow!
Never mind.
Right. Canned 'em.
Jackie: Keep your eye out for the gourd...
And try to blend in.
Uncle: Uncle doesn't blend.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie."
Jackie: (Gasps) Jade!
What are you doing here?
Jade: Get serious.
"Tohru: Uh, sorry, Jackie."
"Jackie: Jade, listen to me."
I told you before we are not here to play games.
"Rickie rothman: Of course you're not, chung family."
You're here to win!
"Johnny chung, right? Rickie rothman, producer."
"Nice to meet ya. Love to chat more,"
but you guys were supposed to be here 2 hours ago.
We're running very late so let's get you on the set.
'K?
Jackie: But we're not--
Jade: Worthy of this great honor.
Rothman: Humble. Nice touch.
"Come on, people. Let's move it."
Places!
Jackie: You're making a mistake.
We aren't the players you want.
Production assistant: Humble. Nice touch.
Uncle: Aiyaa! That belongs to uncle.
Production assistant: No luxury items.
Uncle: Give that back to--
production assistant: And 3...2...1...
Host: Welcome to <i> international</i> à <i> island challenge.</i>
Let's meet our 2 teams.
"From Hamburg, Germany, the dusseldorfs."
"And from Peking, China, it's the chungs."
Uncle: Uncle wants his demon chi detector back right now.
Host: But if one of these families
wants to take home our fabulous prize package
"and the title <i>international island</i> champ,"
they're going to need this-- the all important amnesty idol.
"Win this, and your entire team lives to see another day."
"Lose, and you'll be forced to vote off a member of your own family."
"So, if you're all ready, let's get things started"
with a little fruit punch.
"Tohru: Oh, good. I am kind of thirsty."
"Host: Remember, to win this game,"
each family member must make it across the balance beam
without falling into the slime pit.
"Chung family, you're up."
Jackie: We need to secure the relic.
We don't have time for this.
Jade: They'll hand it to us when we win.
"Now, watch out for the mangos."
Jackie: Yaa!
Aah!
Whoa. Whoa!
Greta Dusseldorf: Aim for the big one.
Heinrich Dusseldorf: <i> Ja!</i>
"Jade: Come on, tohru."
"You're almost there, baby. You can do it!"
"Heinrich: Game over, mountain man."
Jade: Tohru!
(Tohru grunts)
Aah!
Uncle: Ooh. That's gonna leave a mark.
Host: And the dusseldorfs win amnesty!
Kids: Whoo hoo!
"Host: Chungs, I'll see you tonight at the ejection ceremony"
where one of your family members
will be voted off the show.
"Tohru: Sorry, <i> sensei.</i>"
"Jade: Tohru, listen."
"You get my back, I'll get yours."
Tohru: What are you talking about?
"Jade: Power, my friend. If we stick together,"
we can protect ourselves at the ejection ceremony.
Jackie: Jade. Jade: What?
We were just talkin'.
Uncle: Jackie! Bad chi attracts bad chi!
Drago will be on his way soon.
"Jackie: That's why we have to grab that idol,"
find uncle's demon chi detector
and get off this island right away!
Jade: Relax. They're not home.
Jackie: Unh!
"Jade, go back to the tree house."
"Jade: Jackie, 3 words: Flat. Screen. Television."
Jackie: How many times do I have to tell you?
"We must stay focused on our mission,"
not the game.
"Jade: Come on. With my brains and your brawn,"
"we can kick Dusseldorf butt,"
"score all those prizes, and get the gourd."
"Jackie: Shh. Just be quiet,"
and give me a signal if you see anyone coming.
Jade: Great. I love being the lookout.
(Snake hisses)
Jade: Jackie!
Jackie: Aah!
Jackie: Aah!
Jade: don't move around so much.
You're just making it angry.
(Jungle brush rustling)
Jade: Hey... Dusseldorf family! Ha.
"Small island, huh? What's the 4-1-1?"
Dusseldorf dad: I don't understand.
Jade: Tell me about it.
(Snake hisses)
"Jade: Listen. Uh, I think you should know that"
"I just saw this humongo wild boar in your supply crates,"
"and I think it stole your, uh, schnitzel!"
Dad: Schnitzel?!
Jade: Yeah. It just ran off into the bushes!
Dad: Save the schnitzel!
"Jade: Jackie, they're gone."
Jackie: That's a relief. Unh.
Jade: Whoa. Double trouble.
They're back.
Jackie: Unh. Maybe we are going about this the wrong way.
Why don't we just talk to them and ask for the idol?
I'm sure they are reasonable people.
"Hello, Dusseldorf family."
I need to have a word with you.
Now I know this is going to be hard to believe.
But the amnesty idol you have
contains traces of ancient water demon chi
that must be contained to protect the earth
from the forces of darkness.
"So if you will please give me the idol,"
"my uncle will cast a spell to remove the chi,"
and all will be well. Heh heh.
"Jade: Nice try, champ."
"Host: As you know, chungs,"
this is the ejection ceremony
meaning one of you will be going home tonight.
The process is simple.
The person with the most votes
must leave the island immediately.
Let's begin.
"Jade: It's nothing personal, dude."
Uncle: Uncle has been bamboozled!
"Jade, we had a deal!"
Uncle: Uncle not ready to leave!
"Production assistant: Sorry, show policy."
Uncle: What about personal property?
Production assistant: We ship it.
You should get it in about a week.
Ha ha. Or 6.
Uncle: Aieeya!
No helicopter!
Man-made bird cannot be trusted!
(Gasps)
"Production assistant: There is nothing to worry about, sir."
It's perfectly safe.
Uncle: No. Uncle not meant to fly.
Do you see wings on uncle?
"Production assistant: Ok, ok, please calm down, sir."
Tell you what.
There's a supply boat coming in the morning.
You can spend the night here
and take the boat back to the mainland.
Does that sound better?
"Production assistant: So I'll come get you in the morning, ok?"
Uncle: Bring bagels.
(Doorknob rattles)
(Uncle snores)
Cruise director: The ship will be arriving in port in 10 minutes.
We hope you all enjoy your polynesian adventure on boru this afternoon.
But hurry back because mambo madness begins at 4:00 sharp.
Drago: Ah.
(Hisses)
"Drago: This time, the chi's all mine."
"Host: Ok, everybody. New day, new opportunity for amnesty."
So who's - up for a quick bite?
Because each family member
must eat everything on their plate.
"But if you lose your breakfast,"
your family loses the competition.
"So open wide, and down the hatch."
Jackie: We must win this event and get that idol.
Jade: don't talk to me. Talk to coconut.
Heinrich: Ah! Unh! Unh! (Vomits)
(Tohru laughs)
"(Jade gulps) Flat screen TV, here I come."
Jade: Mmph! (Vomits)
Uncle: Aieeya!
No boat! Uncle gets seasick at aquarium!
Production assistant: Nothing to worry about.
Just keep your eyes on the horizon
and you'll be fine.
Uncle: Uncle needs his personal property.
Production assistant: Underneath your seat.
"Hit it, frank!"
(Frank guns engine)
"Host: Because neither team could keep their breakfast down,"
you'll have to compete in a tiebreaker round--
the ultimate tropical test
of physical strength and endurance.
Jade: Bring it on. (Heinrich laughs)
Host: On your mark...
Get set...
Go!
Tohru: Boaah!
(Heinrich laughs)
Jackie: Aah!
Unh! Unh! Aah!
Host: Ah.
(Heinrich and mom Dusseldorf grunt)
Jade: Yes.
Heinrich: Unh!
Dad: Eeeaah! Aah!
Heinrich: Oof!
Jade: Whoo hoo!
Jade: I win! I win! I win! I win! I--
(drago laughs)
"That's where you're wrong, shortstop."
I win.
(Drago laughs)
Jackie: Aah! Hot sand! Hot sand! Hot sand!
Jackie: This is not good.
Dad: Who is that?
What is going on here?
"Host: Uh, this isn't in my script."
"Drago: Water, water, everywhere,"
and more than an ocean to drink.
Jackie: We need uncle!
"Tohru, take Jade and find him."
I'll keep drago busy.
"Jackie: Nice trick, drago."
"But if you ask me,"
your act is still all wet.
"Drago: Nobody likes a critic, chan."
Jade: Jackie!
Tohru: <i> Sensei</i> àis not on the island!
Uncle: You hoo! Water boy!
Tohru: <i> Sensei!</i>
(Uncle yells the reversal spell in Chinese)
(Uncle coughs)
(Captain grumbles)
"Jackie: Uh, those were amazing special effects."
Rothman: Special effects?
"Jade: Uh, yeah."
I don't know how you guys do it
week in and week out.
"Rothman: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was"
"quite a piece of television magic,"
if I do say so myself.
"Host: Well, nobody told me about the Tsunami."
"Rothman: You're the host, pretty boy."
You're not in the loop on everything.
"Jade: Flat screen TV, here I come."
"Rothman: Chungs, you're disqualified."
Jade: What?
Rothman: Your rejected family member
returned to the competition.
"Dusseldorfs, you win!"
(Dusseldorfs cheer)
Jade: What? Did you wanna gloat or something?
Heinrich: May I write you?
Jade: I'm in the book.
"Jackie: Jade, do not be upset."
We captured the demon chi.
"Jade: Uh, can I watch cartoons on it?"
I don't think so.
"Tohru: <i> Sensei,</i> àwhy did you not"
"remove drago's fire power, too?"
Uncle: Fire attached like strong glue to drago's spirit.
It will take much bigger magic to remove.
"Jade: Speaking of scale-face, where did he go?"
"Buoy dings, seagull cries)"
"Jade: Hey Jackie, what was your favourite thing about being a kid?"
"Jackie: Being a kid. Sometime, when I look at a kid,"
"I really say, ""what are they thinking?"""
"They are not worried about pay the bills,"
"the car bill, the house mortgage."
"Sometimes, I really want to--"
yes. I want to go back. Boom! Become a small baby.
I don't want to worry tomorrow
"what kind of stunt I'm gonna do,"
what kind of action sequence.
I have to choreograph all action sequence.
That sometimes really makes me worry.
"That's what's good about children, yeah."
Drago: You look tired.
Why don't you knock off early?
Agent: Ooh!
Drago: Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
Demon chi...
And all for me.
"Jackie chan, yawning: Oh, Jade,"
what are you doing out of--aah!
Drago!
"Drago: Did I wake you, sleepyhead?"
So sorry!
"Jade chan: Hey, Jackie, what are you doing out of--"
wha--drago!
(Jackie and Jade grunt)
"Jade: Ok, jackienator-- you go left, I'll go right,"
and we'll catch drago--
"Jackie: Jade, you stay here."
Jade: You can't go in without backup!
Jackie: Hyah! Hut! Haut!
Have you come to section 13 to turn yourself in?
"Drago: In your dreams, chan."
Jackie: Uhh!
Uhh!
Drago: I'm here to throw a little barbecue.
(Alarm blares) Huh?
"Black: You're surrounded, drago. Game's over."
Drago: Over? I'm just gettin' warmed up.
"Jade: Call me crazy, but I'm thinking it's time for a security upgrade."
Drago: Raaahh!
Surrounded!
Outnumbered!
Maybe I shouldn't have gone solo.
"But I will not repeat <i>your</i> mistakes, father!"
"I will find the biggest, baddest henchmen in the world"
and fulfill my destiny.
(Jade yawns)
Jade: (Gasp) It's my birthday! Yes!
(Loud yawn)
Oh...There you are!
What's everybody doing?
Black: Is the chi containment unit stable?
Uncle chan: You want demon chi kept safe? Yes?
Then let uncle work without lookie-loos!
Jade: Hello! Anybody wanna say something?
"Tohru: Good morning, Jade."
Jade: Is that...All?
don't you know what today is?
Uncle: Hot cha! Very important day!
Day for uncle's hair cut!
"Jade: Aw, come on! You know it's my birthday."
"Now, for breakfast, I want chocolate chip pancakes"
with whipped cream and strawberries and--
"Jackie: I'm sorry, Jade."
Things are a little busy around section 13 this morning.
We will have to celebrate your birthday later.
Jade: What?! How much later?
Jackie: Ehh... Just be patient.
Jade: Oh...
"Drago, quietly: Next."
(Whipping sounds)
Next.
Next!
Punchy: Duh! Get away! Get away!
Drago: Raaah! You are all pathetic!
I'm looking for henchmen--
"bone-crushing, skull-caving henchmen!"
"I can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud, but..."
I never should have fired the enforcers.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, dude."
You seen the rest. Now eyeball the best!
Punchy: Duh!
Henchman: Uhh!
(Buzz) (Smash)
Strikemaster ice: So we got the gig or what?
Drago: What's your name?
Strikemaster ice: They call me strikemaster ice.
"This here's my crew-- dj fist,"
and mc cobra.
"Yo, gecko-boy be buggin'!"
Drago: It's near.
Let's go.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, hold up, dog."
"Now, we don't work for free."
"You want our services, you gots to show some green!"
Yizzle!
Drago: You each now have a small piece of my fire demon power--
dragon speed...
Dragon strength...
And dragon breath.
Strikemaster ice: That'll work!
Drago: You're on the clock now
and we have demon chi to claim.
Uncle: The containment unit is unharmed.
Demon chi cannot escape.
Black: I'm installing heat and motion sensors
to make sure our fire-breathing friend can't pay another visit.
"Jade: All right, then. Let's get Jade's birthday train back on track."
"Hmm...What's first, lunch at pizza burger?"
Or maybe I should open my presents!
Tohru: (Giggles) I love birthdays.
Uncle: Aiyaa! Demon chi has been activated!
Jade: No way. Not on my birthday!
"Uncle: Dai gui, the earth demon."
Tohru: The flower of the immortals.
The demon chi is trapped within.
Jackie: The coronado bridge in San Diego!
"I am sorry, Jade."
Your birthday celebration will have to wait just a little longer.
Jade: That's ok. We can party in San Diego!
Jackie: Uh... It's too dangerous.
You will stay here.
Jade: That's not right.
You can't dis the birthday girl.
Uncle: Demon chi is very close.
Jackie: Then all we have to do is find the...
Flower.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie!"
Jackie: Aah!
Uncle: Demon chi is in this room.
Florist: Ahem! May I help you?
"Jackie: Uh, it's a flower freshness detector."
My uncle is very picky.
Drago: So am I. I want a flower that smells like demon chi.
(All gasp)
Tohru: Drago.
Jackie: And... Strikemaster ice?
"Jade: Hey, pizza-face got a drago makeover!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo dog, you didn't say nothin' about puttin' the hurt on chan."
First day on the job and we're already gettin' a bonus.
(Attack cries and grunting)
Drago: Chi loves me... Chi loves me not.
"Jade: (Gasps) Hurry, uncle!"
Jackie: Uhh!
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, start pickin' out flowers, chan, for your funer--"
ah-ah-ah-choo!
Jackie: Bless you?
Strikemaster ice: Ah-choo!
Whoo! Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Jackie: You must be allergic.
Strikemaster ice: Ah-choo!
Jackie: Bless you.
(Flower pots crashing)
Jackie: Bless you.
Strikemaster ice: Ah-choo!
"Uncle: No, no."
Strikemaster ice: Ah-choo!
Uncle: No...No...
Uncle: Hot cha!
Drago: For me? You shouldn't have.
Jade: Hee-yah!
I picked this for you.
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Tohru: Uhh!
Strikemaster ice: Ah--
uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Drago: No!
Uhh!
Florist: My hydrangeas!
"Uncle: Jackie, pay nice man."
"Jade: Now that we have the flower power,"
it's time to party down!
I'm still the birthday girl for 10 more hours.
Jackie: We'll be back home in time for a big birthday dinner.
Uncle: Aiyaa!
Jackie: Huh?
"Jade: Oh, no!"
Uncle: Moon demon tso LAN?
Lotus pod?
One more chi is nearby!
Turn car around!
Tohru: 2 demon chi powers on the same day?
Jade: Figures.
"Tohru: I'm sorry, Jade."
You know we would all prefer to celebrate your birthday.
Jade: (Sighs) Whatever.
Drago: Was that a joke back there?
Did I hire clowns?
I give you powers beyond your wildest imagination
"and you amateurs can't get past an archaeologist,"
"a tub of guts, an old man, and a little girl?!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, he's buggin' again!"
Drago: You three are about to get a second chance.
"Tohru: I know it isn't much, but happy birthday."
"Jade: Oh, thanks, t."
Uncle: Moon demon chi is there!
"(Drago growls and Jackie, Jade, uncle, and tohru gasp)"
"Jackie: Jade, stay here."
Jade: Oh!
Drago: Smells like chi spirit.
Jade: Step away from the lotus pod!
Jackie: Jade!
"Jade: I'm your backup, remember?"
Tohru: The demon chi stays. You go.
Drago: We'll see about that.
What? It was here a second ago.
Uncle: Moon demon chi-- control over gravity.
(Drago snarls)
"Jade: Uncle, let's bring the ""floater"""
back down to earth.
Tohru: Uhh!
Uhh!
Ooh!
"Jade: Hey, boy, come over here!"
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Jade: Mmm! Cotton candy! Yummy in your tummy!
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee--
Jade: No hitchhiking!
Drago: I'll come back for you later.
Jackie: Whoooooa!
Uhh!
Tohru: Uh...Whoops.
Jackie: Which way did they go?
Bwaa!
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"Bad day, bad--bad day!"
Jade: Uncle!
Uncle: Leave Chinese Bear alone!
"(Fist, cobra, ice, and drago scream)"
(Seals clapping)
"Jackie: Nice panda, come to--"
wh-whooaaa!
Jade: Jackie!
Jackie: Whooaaa--oof!
"Good catch, tohru."
"Jade: Step on it, t!"
"Jackie: don't worry, we'll bring it back later! Thank you!"
Jade: Whoa! The panda's going all moony.
Uncle: Panda will return to normal once the demon chi is removed.
"Jade: Hey, boy, trade ya!"
Cotton candy for that yucky demon chi!
Uncle and tohru: Yu-mo- gue-guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao.
Jade: Yes! And now it's time for Jade's birthday bash!
Uncle: Uncle was afraid of this.
Tohru: <i> Sensei?</i>
Uncle: Chi-o-matic can only hold one power at a time!
Drago: Fore!
Now that is some serious hang time!
Uncle: Jackie! Drago must not obtain earth demon chi!
You must become living vessel.
Jade: Ooh! Ooh! Let me be the living vessel!
I can handle it. I have experience.
"Come on, it's my birthday!"
Drago: It's a 2-for-1 special.
Noooooo!
"Jackie: Ooh, tingly."
Uncle: Jackie! Do not let drago touch you!
He will try to drain demon chi!
"Drago: Oh, I won't just touch you, chan."
I'll rip you apart!
Jackie: Did I do that?
Uncle: Of course!
Why do you think it is called earth demon chi?
"Jade: You dine with the t, you get a helping of the j."
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, shortstop,"
"why don't you let the grown-ups handle this, a-ight?"
Jade: Afraid I'll whoop your butts again?
"Strikemaster ice: You got the crust, little lady."
Let's see if you got the sauce.
Whoa!
"Drago: Hey, chan...Catch!"
(Jackie coughs)
Jackie: Uncle! Have you fixed the chi-o-matic?
Uncle: Do not rush uncle!
Drago: Fire in the hole!
Jackie: Aah!
"Drago: All that digging must have made you thirsty, chan."
How about a little juice?
Tingly.
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Drago: No!
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao.
(Rumbling and crackling)
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, ice gonna bring the heat!"
Jade: And this is for ruining my birthday!
Hee-yah!
"Come on, yin-Yang, let's get you home."
(Footsteps)
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, d, a little hizzle?"
(Drago roars)
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue- guai-fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao.
Yu-mo-gue-guai-fie- Dee-tsao.
"Black: 4 down, 4 to go."
Jackie: And someone is still the birthday girl for 4 more minutes.
(Jade snoring)
Jackie: Shh. She is sleeping.
"Jade: Hey Jackie, is there a yin and Yang to your personality?"
Jackie: Yin-Yang. I think everybody have a yin-Yang.
"Yin-Yang. Sometimes I feel I'm very strong,"
but sometimes I do feel I'm very weak.
"In my body, the Yang always want to beat the ying."
"Sometimes when I'm doing a stunt,"
"this side tell me, ""dangerous,"""
"but another side tell me, ""no, you can do it."""
"So, this way, I do have a yin-Yang, yes."
Jackie chan: Thank you for allowing me to ride with you.
The museum asked that I help ensure
that the golden squid is unloaded safely.
"Driver: Hey, I appreciate the company."
You wouldn't believe how dull this job is.
(Helicopter approaching)
Driver: Wh-what do I do?!
Do--do I pull over?!
Jackie: No! Keep driving! Radio the police!
Jackie: Oof!
Jackie: Waa!
Mu-ahh! Hah!
Unh! Whoa!
(Weapon sputtering)
Jackie: High heat and rubber soles
make for a sticky situation.
Thieves: Huh? (Crunching)
"Jackie: When we arrive at the police station,"
you will be--wha?!
"Capt. Black: Just got word about the attempted hijacking, Jackie."
Jackie: Captain black? But how--
capt. Black: You know section 13 monitors all police transmissions.
Can you I.D. The perps?
"Jackie: Well, at first I suspected the enforcers,"
but they were sent to prison last month.
Capt. Black: And released 3 days ago.
Court ordered them to serve out the rest of their sentences
doing community service.
"Jackie: If they are back to their old ways,"
the community does not need that kind of service.
Capt. Black: Enforcers can't be reincarcerated
"without proof of criminal activity,"
but you catch 'em red-handed
"and I'll see to it that they're put away for a long, long time."
"Jackie: Jade, what are you doing?"
"Those clothes are being donated to charity,"
and that is your buttercup scout uniform.
Jade chan: I know. I quit the buttercups.
Jackie: Wha? Why?
"Jade: Quilt-making, cookie-selling, hello?"
"If I wanted to be bored out of my gourd,"
I could just hang here with you and uncle.
"Uncle chan: You want excitement,"
sweep up shop.
"Jackie: Ohh! But scouting provides a valuable experience, Jade."
You mustn't quit.
Jade: So who said anything about quitting scouting?
I joined the dragon scouts.
Jackie: But the dragon scouts are all boys.
Jade: <i> Were.</i>
Welcome to the new millennium
where girls are hot and boys are not.
I am dragon. Hear me roar!
"The dragons are meeting tonight at my school, uncle Jackie."
"Jackie: Jade, what did you do?"
"Jackie: Uh, friends of yours?"
Jade: Nope. Something about them seems...
"Familiar, though."
You gotta turn that in at the principal's office.
Jackie: Fine. I will see you in the hallway
after your meeting.
(Banging)
"Finn: Come on, come on."
Ratso: Not you.
"Jackie: You failed to hijack the antiquities,"
so now you're robbing school lockers?
Chow: What's he talkin' about?
Jackie: May I have a look?
"Finn: Last time I checked, you ain't the hall monitor,"
"so take a hike, chan."
Jackie: Perhaps you have something to hide.
Chow: Perhaps you don't hear so good.
Jackie: I do not want to fight you...
At school.
"Finn: Too bad, 'cause here comes today's lesson."
Jackie: Ow!
Dragon leader: What in Sam hill
is going on here?!
Finn: Uh...
Bucket turned over.
"Dragon leader: Looks more like horseplay,"
and horseplay undermines discipline.
A fine example you're setting
"for your boy, Mr. Finn."
Jackie: Boy? You have a boy?
Finn: My nephew.
"Chow: Mine, too."
"Ratso: My sister's kid, visitin' for the Summer."
Frank: Frank.
Charley: Charley.
"Rocko: Uh, rocko."
"Dragon leader: All right, dragons,"
"store your gear, on the double."
Jackie: Why were you breaking in to that locker?
"Finn: We weren't, Mr. nosy."
We're doin' community service here.
Part of the deal for gettin' out of the joint early.
"Jackie: Oh! Oh, you are janitors."
Chow: Hey! Custodial engineers.
Finn: Ot-nay in front of the ephews-nay.
"Finn: Look, chan, whole reason we want the kids to be scouts"
is to learn good values.
"Ratso: So they don't end up bums, like us."
"Rocko: Ha ha ha! You're funny, uncle ratso."
"Charley: Yeah, seein' how you guys own,"
"like, the biggest import-export business"
on the west coast.
"Chow: Heh. Yeah, well, you know,"
we ain't ones to brag.
Jackie: Who would've guessed that the enforcers
would have such nice nephews?
Jade: Nice? Jackie!
"Those three have ""crooked"" written all over 'em!"
But don't worry. I'm all over it.
"I'll be your eyes and ears,"
find out what they're cookin' up.
"Jackie: Jade, we must not prejudge."
Sometimes the apple falls far from the tree.
Jade: And hits the ground and turns rotten.
Jade: Gotta go with my gut on this one.
"Something about those nephews isn't right,"
and I'll prove it.
Just need a little backup.
Capt. Black: Jade?
"Jade: Hello, old friend!"
Cock-a-doodle how-do-you do?
(Jackie yawns)
Jackie: Jade? Where are you heading?
"Jade: Dragon scouts meeting, Jackie."
Going for my first merit badge.
"Jackie: Oh. So, what will you be doing?"
Some sort of arts and crafts project?
"Jade: Crafts? Get real, Jackie."
Dragon leader promised it'd be something in the wild.
Probably an intense survival program in the jungle
surrounded by bloodthirsty creatures!
Gotta be kidding me.
"<i>This</i> is what he calls being ""in the wild""?"
"Dragon leader: All right, dragon scouts,"
"your first merit badge will be in nature studies,"
and today we'll be bird-watching.
Jade: Bird-watching?
"Dragon leader: Present dragon scopes,"
front and center.
Dragon leader: Outstanding.
You have 60 minutes.
Notate all sightings in your logbooks.
"I will be spot-checking,"
and the zoo area is off limits! Fall out!
Jade: Ice cream heist at 10 o'clock.
Frank: You got a problem?
We're tryin' to bird-watch here.
Charley: Yeah. We been scopin' out a pigeon.
Rocko: Pretty pigeon.
Jade: Not on my watch.
"Frank: Oh, I get it."
"She can't cut it solo,"
so she's tryin' to tag along.
Jade: As if!
"Charley: She's a wannabe, same as her uncle."
"Jade: Uh, reality check?"
<i>My</i> uncle's a wannabe?
"Charley: Uh, yeah."
We got the 411 how your unc is bunk.
Rocko: Ha ha ha! Unc is bunk. Ha ha ha!
Charley: He can't even hold down a job.
Frank: Heh heh heh. Wishes he was big-time
like our uncles.
Charley: Which is why he's always followin' them around.
Nephews: Loser!
"Jade: Hey, the only reason Jackie's always tailing your uncles"
is because they're low-life crooks.
Rocko: Take it back!
"Jade: Bring it on, tiny."
Rocko: Whoa--unh!
Jade: Who's the l-word now?
"Frank: Uh, Jade,"
a little advice...
Jade: What's that supposed to--hey!
Nephews: 3-way keep-away! Ha ha ha!
Jade: You just bought yourselves a world of hurt!
Give that back!
(Jade sniffs)
Jade: Ohh! Yuck.
Serious stank.
(Bear growls)
"Jade: Got it. Your pad, my bad."
Jade: Ohh!
(Bear roars)
"Jade: Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
"Frank: Oh, man, we gotta help her!"
Charley: How?
"Rocko: Uh, I got nothin'."
Frank: That jump was freaky.
Charley: Freaky on a stick.
How do you get that kind of hang time?
"Jade: Um, aerobics?"
Rocko: Ha ha. She was pretty gutsy with that Bear.
"Not like before, when she's all,"
"(high-pitched voice) ""I want my cap back."""
"Charley, high-pitched voice: I want my cap back! Give me my cap back!"
"Frank: Please, oh, please!"
Nephews: Ha ha ha!
Jade: You are so asking to get your butts kicked.
Dragon leader: Dragon scout Jade!
You disobeyed a direct dragon order
"to stay clear of the zoo,"
and now I see you displaying aggressive behavior
towards your fellow scouts.
Frank: Yeah. Dragon scout Jade
definitely needs an attitude adjustment.
"Charley: Oh, she's a bad egg."
Rocko: I like eggs... Over easy.
Jade: But they--
dragon leader: No merit badge.
Jade: Ohh!
"Finn: Well, what do you know?"
"don't you ever get tired of tailing us, chan?"
"Jackie: Uh, actually, yes,"
but that is not why I am here.
"I guess the dragon leader called you in, too."
"My niece and your nephews, fighting."
Ratso: We came to pick up our uniforms.
Jackie: Uniform?
Dragon leader: Volunteering to be dragon daddies.
Outstanding.
No wonder your nephews are such fine young men.
On the other hand...
"Fall in behind me, Mr. chan."
We need to discuss Jade's behavior.
"Chow: Heh. If you need some parenting tips, chan,"
I'm here for ya.
Enforcers: Ha ha ha!
"Jackie: And the dragon leader warned me,"
"any more of this type of behavior,"
you will be kicked out.
"So, please,"
behave yourself on this weekend's dragon adventure.
Jade: We're having a dragon adventure?
It's gonna be something cool!
Extreme go-kart racing?
Mountain climbing?
Jackie: The museum.
Jade: I quit the buttercups for this?
Jackie: The museum has just opened its far east exhibit.
I do not like this one bit.
Jade: You and me both. Bor-ing!
Jackie: I suspect the golden squid
is the reason the enforcers
volunteered to be dragon daddies.
Jade: I get it.
"A dragon adventure,"
the perfect cover for a heist.
"Jackie: Perhaps, which is why I am coming along."
Jade: Good thinking.
"I'll keep an eye - on frank, Rocco, and Charley"
while you-- you're a dragon daddy?!
Jackie: Yes--ohh!
And you are levitating!
You have the rooster talisman!
Jade: Well--heh heh. I--
"please, uncle Jackie, let me take it to the museum."
If the enforcers try to pull anything--
uncle: Eye-yah! Magic is not to be trifled with!
"Jackie: Hand over the talisman, ja--ow!"
"Uncle: As long as you are up there,"
clean cobwebs from ceiling.
"Curator: Welcome, dragon scouts."
You are about to see the finest collection of far east antiquities
"ever assembled in the northern hemisphere,"
and the centerpiece of our collection
"is the exquisite - 3,000-year-old golden squid."
Priceless.
Finn: Priceless is my favorite number.
Frank: Sweet.
Charley: Boo-bama.
Rocko: Pretty.
Jade: don't even think about it.
Jackie: Why are you leaving your group?
"Finn: Potty break, ok?"
Jackie: All three at the same time?
"Dragon scouts, gasping: Hey! What's going on?!"
"Dragon leader: As you were, dragons."
Remain calm.
Curator: - Just a power outage.
(Generator hums)
"Dragon scouts, gasping: Huh? What happened? What?"
Jackie: What has happened?!
Curator: The golden squid...
It's been stolen!
The culprits may still be on the premises.
Evacuate the children!
Jackie: I agree.
"Dragon leader: All right, dragons,"
single file in double time. Move out!
Jackie: Stop!
Jackie: I have caught you red-handed with...
Toilet paper?
Ratso: We're runnin' low at home.
"Chow: Whatcha gonna do,"
call the potty patrol?
"Jackie: But if you didn't steal the golden squid,"
then who?
Jade: Yes!
I am <i> good.</i>
"Frank: Oh, that's my locker!"
"Charley: Back away, or you're gonna pay!"
Jade: You three are so busted.
"Frank: Heh heh heh. Pretty lame, Jade."
You swiped that thing and planted it in my locker.
"Jade: Ooh, good cover story."
Not! What kind of criminals are you?
"Man: Oh, they're not criminals..."
But we are.
Jade: It's the museum curator!
"Charley: Ohh, didn't see that coming."
Frank: Inside job.
Rocko: Yeah!
Inside where?
Curator: Heh heh heh.
I'll take that.
Jade: Guess again.
Jade to frank!
Frank: Frank to rocko!
"Finn: Uhh! Hey, watch the hair!"
Community service stinks.
Chow: No kidding. - I make holes. He fills holes.
"Finn: Boys, I think our ship just came in."
"Chow: Hey, he's got the golden squid!"
Finn: I stand corrected.
Community service does have its rewards.
Curator: Ohh!
Finn: Mm-wah.
"Gentlemen, the only street we're gonna be working"
from now on is easy street.
Ratso: Ohh! Why can't <i> we</i> ever win?
Jackie: Heh heh heh. I came to apologize
for falsely accusing you of stealing the...
Jackie: The golden squid!
You <i> did</i> steal it!
"Finn: Not exactly, but it's ours now."
Ratso: Got it off the real thief fair and square.
Jackie: It is museum property.
Jackie: Whoa!
Oof! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!
Jackie: Think of it this way.
"You have not lost a statue,"
you have become a statue.
"Finn: Um, chan, please,"
"uh, don't tell the kids about this."
Chow: Yeah. - It'd break their hearts.
"Ratso: They think we're, you know..."
Jackie: Successful import-exporters?
I will spare them the truth.
Finn: Thanks. Who knows?
"Maybe someday we can redeem ourselves,"
"become the upstanding, law-abiding citizens"
they think we are.
Finn: Nah.
Chow and ratso: No way. I don't think so.
Finn: Scary thought.
Ratso: Be laughin' if I could breathe.
Capt. Black: The curator and his lackeys
"are in custody, Jackie."
Turns out he's a con artist named Michael Diaz.
Has a rap sheet long as my arm.
"Finn: Yeah, so, we're gonna take a ride with,"
"uh, our associate Mr. black to the airport."
Ratso: Gonna be goin' away for a while...
Chow: To the far east.
Big business deal brewin'.
"Sorry, kids."
"That's the, uh, import-export business for ya."
Frank: We'll come visit again next Summer.
Finn: Terrific. We should be out--
"er, uh, back by then."
"Frank: Take it easy, uncle Finn."
"Charley: Ciao, uncle chow."
"Rocko: Later, uncle ratso. Thanks for everything."
"Nephews: Bye, now! See ya soon!"
"Jackie: I do not encourage lying, Jade,"
but there is no need to tell the young men
that their uncles are going to prison.
"Jade: Hey, uncle Jackie,"
better not let the dragon leader
catch you out of uniform.
Nephews and Jade: 4-way keep-away! Ha ha ha!
Jackie: Give me that back.
This is not funny!
It is very disrespectful!
"Jane: Hey Jackie, do you have any bad jobs before you became an actor?"
"Jackie: After the 10 years in a martial arts school,"
I went to Australia.
"I do a construction worker,"
"clean the, uh, building..."
Cement...
Paint the wall...
"At night, I doing, uh,"
"kitchen, uh,"
learn how to cook.
"Um, I don't think it's a bad job."
"If I'm continue to learn this,"
I'm becoming like a professional.
There's no bad job.
(Music playing)
Uncle: The flute of the immortals.
Uncle: Within it lies the chi of the sky demon hsi wu.
Jade: Who else is up for a spin?
Jackie: Jade! What are you doing here?
Jade: Like I'm gonna come all the way down to Australia
and not ride a kangaroo? Tch!
Uncle: <i> Yu mo gue guai</i> à <i> fi de ziao...</i>
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i> à <i> fi de--yeow!</i>
"Jackie: Drago! Uncle, hurry!"
Uncle: Aiyaaa! Nephew has ants in pants.
Magic cannot be rushed.
(Chanting faster)
Jade: Hyah!
Both: Whoa!
(Screaming)
Drago: Time to throw this shrimp on the Barbie.
Jade: Definitely not a g'day.
Jackie: Jade!
Jade: Whoooaaa!
Jackie: Whoa! Unh! Aah!
Uncle: Jackie!
Must stop drago from extracting sky demon chi!
"Jade: Oh, man, I'm gonna hurl!"
"Jackie: Hang on tight, Jade!"
Unh!
Drago: Aah! Unh!
(Uncle chanting)
"Jade: We came, we saw, we kicked demon butt!"
(Tires screech)
"Uncle: Hmm. Tohru, put steering wheel back where it belongs."
Drago: Unh!
Drago: Chan!
"Jade: Hey, since we're still on Australian time,"
technically it's tomorrow and I've already been to school.
"Jackie: Ha ha ha. ""A"" for effort, but ""f"" for logic."
Now go to bed. You have your big field trip tomorrow.
Jade: Ohhh!
Uncle: Aiya! Sky demon chi did not transfer into containment tank.
Jackie: Do you need help?
"Uncle: Yes, very important. Write down."
"Mung bean, bulb of garlic,"
"essence of sea salt, with mustard, on wheat."
Jackie: These ingredients will repair the chi-o-matic?
Uncle: No! Ingredients for sandwich.
"You fix uncle snack, uncle will fix chi-o-matic."
"Jade: Lunch, check. Permission slip, check."
"Jackie: Jade, it is a long bus ride."
Take something to occupy yourself.
"Jade: Boredom buster, check-o-matic."
"Ms. hardman: ...And the windsor mansion is not only a national landmark,"
it's on the national registry of homes
as a perfect example of 19th century architecture.
"Now, I expect you all to be on your very best behavior."
"Drew: I know this girl, who has this friend,"
"who has this cousin, who went there with his family"
and his sister saw a really freaky ghost.
Jade: As if! Everybody knows there are no such things as ghosts.
"But demons? They're real, big time!"
And this little baby here can suck up demon chi like nobody's business!
Ms. hardman: Jade!
I will not have you disrupting this field trip
"with any of your silly ""forces of darkness"" stories,"
and no electronic games during school hours.
"Jade: But, Ms. hardman, it's not a game. It's--"
"Ms. hardman: No ""buts,"" young lady."
You've just earned the class a 2-page report
on the historical significance of the windsor mansion.
"All: Aw, man! I can't believe that! Thanks a lot, Jade!"
Ms. hardman: Or would you care to make it 3 pages?
"Jade: Hey, it's not my fault Ms. hartless has it in for all of us."
She loves torturing kids. Why do you think she became a teacher?
(Bus driving over gravel)
Drago: The sky demon chi. I'm back in business!
Uncle: Jackie!
Uncle: Chi-o-matic is missing!
Both: Jade!
(Thunder)
Drew: Whoa! Total creepfest.
Jade: Please. Tourist trap.
All: Aaah!
Guide: Windsor mansion was built in 1857 by Gladys windsor...
"But is now quite famous for its more ""spirited"" guests."
(Slam)
Drew: Aah!
Jade: That's a big goose egg on the goosebump meter.
Ms. hardman: Jade! One more negative comment and--
(gasps)
Drew: Whoa! Definitely haunted!
Guide: You may not believe what you're about to see next.
This way...To the basement.
"Ms. hardman: Oh, these shoes!"
I guess that's the price you pay for high fashion.
"Ms. hardman: Oh, dear, someone's missing."
Jade.
Guide: Prepare yourselves...
(Gasping)
Guide: For the most complete antique doorknob collection
west of the Mississippi!
"Girl: Aww, that's it?!"
Ms. hardman: Everyone remain here with Mr. Freedman.
I'll be right back.
"Guide: Well, now, who knows the difference"
between a doorknob and a door pull?
Anyone? Hands?
"Jade: Duh, pre-recorded ghosts."
Jade: Player piano. I knew it!
I've been in libraries scarier than this tourist trap.
Jade: Aah!
(Jade screams)
Ms. hardman: Jade?
"Drago: Oh, did I scare you?"
"Jade: Yeah, but looks aren't everything!"
Drago: I want the sky demon chi!
It's here!
I can smell it!
Ms. hardman: Jade!
Jade: Ms. hardman?
(Screeches)
Drago: The sky demon chi?!
"Ms. hardman: Oh, my! What's--what's happened to me?"
Jade: Claws for hands? Demon wings?
Evil twinkle in the eye?
Something tells me uncle never emptied the chi-o-matic.
That's 2 demons against one chan. I'm outta here!
Ms. hardman: Jade! Come back here!
Drago: Raah!
"Guide: And that, students, is the fascinating history"
of the doorknob in 19th century America.
"Now, if you'll follow me to the gift shop..."
(Slams)
"(Nervous laugh) Well, that's strange."
The door - appears to be stuck.
Drew: I knew it! We're ghost chow!
(Screaming)
Guide: Aaah!
Children: Help!
Help! I want to get out of here! Mommy!
(Screeches)
(Claws scratching)
"Jade: Oh, - this is all my fault!"
I turned my teacher into a drooling demon
at an all-you-can-eat student buffet!
"don't worry, guys. I got your back."
"Yo, Ms. hartless!"
Ms. hardman: Jade?
Jade: You want fresh meat?
"Well, here's some prime ""grade j""!"
Come and get it!
"Ms. hardman: Come back here, young lady!"
(Panting)
Jade: Definitely not a special effect.
Aah!
"Ms. hardman, don't eat me!"
I didn't even shower this morning!
Uncle: Teacher eat students?
School has changed since uncle was a boy.
Jade: Uncle Jackie! Ms. hardman took the chi-o-matic on the bus
"and must have zapped herself with the sky demon chi,"
and now she wants to eat me and the rest of the class who are trapped in the basement!
"(Gasps) Oh, and drago's here and the house is really spook central."
"Jackie: - Uh, Jade, calm down."
I am sure Ms. hardman does not wish to harm you.
"Jade: Oh, yeah, she just loves kids! Medium rare."
"Tohru: Uh, did you say haunted?"
"Jade: So, what's the plan?"
Jackie: You go to the bus with uncle while he fixes the chi-o-matic.
And you will stay there until we sort this whole thing out.
Jade: No way!
Jackie: Yes way!
I will see that drago does no harm to Ms. hardman.
(Tohru groans)
Uncle: (Sighs) Good as new!
"Now, Jade, stay on bus--"
Jade?
Tohru: There are no such things as ghosts.
There are no such things as ghosts.
Aaah!
"Jackie: - Aah! Oh, this is why I prefer carpeting!"
Jade: Aah!
"Jackie: Jade, I told you to stay on the bus!"
Jade: What's your point?
(Ms. hardman screeches)
Ms. hardman: What do you want?
"Drago: What do you think, lady?!"
You just sprouted wings out of thin air?
You have my sky demon chi and I want it back!
(Loud thud)
(Ms. hardman screeches)
Drago: Yeow!
Ms. hardman: Maybe next time you'll remember the magic word.
Jackie: Leave her alone!
"Drago: Back off, chan!"
Uncle: Aiya!
"Jade: Keep away from me, birdbrain! Aah!"
Jackie: Jade!
Jade: Uncle Jackie!
Uncle: Uh-oh.
Aiyaaaa!
(Roars)
Uncle: Bear should go into permanent hibernation!
Jackie: Aah!
Ha ha! Happy birthday?
Drago: Aaah!
"Jackie: Uh, uncle? This place...Explain."
Uncle: Double dose of demon chi has awakened angry spirits in house.
Jackie: We must find Jade.
(Children yelling)
Tohru: Ooh!
(Children yelling)
Tohru: Ohh...A laundry chute.
(Grunting)
I'm coming to get you!
(Tohru grunting)
(Screaming)
Tohru: Unh! Hello.
Guide: Ohhh...
(Ms. hardman humming)
"Jade: Heh, you must be working up quite an appetite."
Why don't I just hop out and dig you up some juicy jumbo-size worms?
Ms. hardman: You're not going anywhere.
"Jade: Ms. hardman, don't hurt me!"
"Ms. hardman: Hurt you?! Oh, my goodness!"
"Jade chan, - what an imagination you have!"
I brought you up here to protect you from that awful lizard boy.
(Uncle panting)
Uncle: Fancy mansion needs elevator!
(Panting)
(Rumbling)
Guide: Aaah! Aaah!
(Guide whimpering)
Ms. hardman: (Laughs) And to think I used to be afraid to fly.
Jade: So you don't hate kids? You don't hate...Me?
"Ms. hardman: Oh, Jade, I adore children."
Why else would I be a teacher?
Drago: I'm back!
Both: Aah!
Ms. hardman: Stay here! I know exactly how to deal with an unruly student.
"Jade: Ms. hardman, no!"
Drago: Teacher's got a pet. How cute.
"Jade: Hey, scaly!"
(Growling)
Jade: Ms. hardman!
Jade: No!
(Panting)
Jackie: Jade!
Jackie: Aah!
(Eerie moan)
Jade: Aaaah!
Jackie: Aah! Oof!
"Jackie: Come and get me, drago."
Drago: Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ms. hardman: Class dismissed!
Drago: Aah!
"Ms. hardman: Huh. Well, this certainly has been"
more exciting than grading papers.
Jade: I think it's about time we get you back to normal.
"Ms. hardman: Oh, but I was considering flying south for the winter."
"Jade: Ms. hardman, the class can't lose you."
You're everyone's favorite teacher.
Ms. hardman: I am?
Ms. hardman: (Sighs) I'm ready.
(Uncle chanting)
Jade: So everything was just bogus special effects.
Drew: Ha! Knew it!
Ms. hardman: - But I-I'm certain I had wings
and I saved Jade. I was a hero!
"Jackie: Uh, Ms. hardman, I am afraid the mansion"
has a way of playing tricks with people's minds.
"Ms. hardman: But, Jade, you did tell me"
"I was everyone's favorite teacher, isn't that right?"
"Class, follow me!"
"Uncle: With the demon chi gone, spirits have returned to rest."
"Tohru: I was never really scared, <i> sensei.</i>"
Tohru: Uncle?
Jade: Have you ever dressed up for a costume party or Halloween?
"Jackie: When I'm very young,"
"yes, I do wear a cowboy costume,"
"but when I get in the film business, never."
"Why? Because every day I'm on the set,"
dressed as different people.
"I'm dressed like an old man, young man, girl, old lady,"
"uh, magician, vampire-- I dress everything already."
"Uncle: Ah, the city of fengdu,"
uncle's hometown.
Uncle cannot believe
this is last time he will ever see it.
"Jackie: Oh, that must mark"
how high the flood waters will rise
when the new dam is finished.
Tohru: - Everything will be submerged?
"Uncle: The original birthplace of the chan family,"
gone forever.
"That is why uncle needed to come,"
and that is why the two of you needed to join me.
(Music playing)
Jade: Hey!
Uncle: Turn off racket and listen to uncle!
This is your history.
"Jade: Yeah, ancient history. Give it back!"
Uncle: You are stubborn as mule!
Jade: I am not stubborn! I'm independent!
Uncle: Oh!
Jade: Now what am I supposed to listen to?
Uncle: How about uncle?
"Tohru: <i>Sensei,</i> what is that?"
Uncle: Ai-yah!
Mingshan temple.
Dark magic.
Legendary home to ancient mirror spirits--
evil tricksters
who make your worst fears about yourself come true.
Jade: Big deal. I'm spending my vacation here.
My worst fear has <i> already</i> come true.
Spirits: Help!
Help!
Help!
Spirit #1: Help! Somebody!
Spirit #2: We're starving! We need light!
Spirit #3: Release us now!
"Lead spirit: Quiet, fools!"
Spirit #3: How else are we supposed to get a human's attention?
"We need physical hosts to escape this mirror, remember?"
"Spirit #2: Yeah, - and we'll be underwater soon."
Spirit #1: And I can't swim.
Lead spirit: Patience.
I sense that - the means of our freedom
are drawing very near.
(Spirits laugh)
Uncle: House was here. School was here.
Best place for noodle in city was here.
"So, what do you think of uncle's old stomping grounds?"
Jade: Tch. Looks more like it was stomped <i>into</i> the ground.
"Jackie: Uncle, I read that most of fengdu's sacred buildings"
were moved to higher ground.
Why did they leave the mingshan temple here?
Uncle: Nothing sacred about mingshan.
Even small children were taught never to go inside.
Imprisoned mirror spirits are very crafty--
will take over your body
and make your worst fears a reality.
Jade: Sounds like one of those urban legend things
they tell kids to make them behave.
"Uncle: In uncle's day, children behave regardless..."
Unlike now.
Jade: Hrmph.
Jackie: Uh...
Perhaps we should visit the temple anyway.
There may be artifacts inside worth preserving.
"Uncle: Thank you, big-headed know-it-all, for your input,"
but I think uncle knows more
about mingshan temple than you.
Some things are better left at the bottom of the river.
"Now, as I was saying,"
third cousin once-removed house was there.
He still owes uncle money.
Spirits: Help!
Help!
"Jackie: Tohru, do you think uncle is right?"
Am I a big-headed know-it-all?
Jade?
Jade: Hello?
Spirits: Help!
Jade: Who's there?
Spirits: Help!
Help!
Tohru: Jade!
Jackie: Where are you?
Uncle: Touch nothing!
Were uncle's lips not moving?
Did words about temple not come out of uncle's mouth?
Why no one ever listen to uncle?
"Jackie: - Uhh. We weren't ignoring you,"
but we have to find Jade.
Perhaps we should split up--
unless you think I'm being a know-it-all again.
"Uncle: - Touch nothing else, big head."
Spirits: Help!
Help!
"Jade: Uh, someone in here?"
Spirit #1: This way!
Spirit #2: That's right!
Lead spirit: You!
"Yes, you, young lady."
Over here.
Jade: Whoa! Uncle wasn't kidding.
You guys are - the evil mirror spirits.
Spirit #3: - Evil? We're not evil.
(Jade gasps)
"Lead spirit: - No, don't! Wait! Please!"
"We are not evil, little one. We're good--"
"good spirits unjustly trapped for centuries,"
waiting for someone brave and kind enough
to smash this prison and set us free.
Jade: That's not what I heard.
Spirit #3: Lies!
Spirit #2: You heard wrong!
Spirit #1: I couldn't hear. What'd she hear?
"Lead spirit: I assure you, we mean no harm."
Our only purpose is to Grant wishes.
"Jade: Yeah, right."
"Lead spirit: Well, if you're going to be"
a stubborn mule about it...
Spirits: Stubborn mule! Stubborn mule! Stubborn mule!
Jade: Stop it!
Tohru: Jade!
Jade: What?
Tohru: Uncle warned you not to come inside the temple.
It's too dangerous.
Jade: Like I haven't seen danger before.
Stop being so over-protective.
You're starting to act like your mom.
Tohru: I am not like my mother.
Spirit #1: Just like your mother!
Spirit #2: Who's your mommy?
"Spirit #3: Mother, may I?"
(Tohru shudders)
Spirits: Light!
Jade: We can't let the mirror break!
The spirits will get out!
(Jade gasps)
Tohru: Look out!
Uncle: Aah!
Uncle: Dark magic!
Why does uncle bother speaking?
Lead spirit: No!
Jade: Tohru! Behind you!
(Both grunt)
Uncle: Ai-yaah!
Protect the mirror!
Lead spirit: Ignorant creatures!
We will not be denied!
(Tohru grunts)
Uncle: Does no one have ears?
Mirror must not shatter!
Jackie: Ohh! Bad day!
(Jackie panting)
(Spirits laughing)
(Jackie screams)
(Spirit #1 laughs)
(Jade shudders)
(Spirit #3 laughs)
(Tohru shudders)
(Spirit #2 laughs)
Jackie: Ohh...
(Lead spirit laughs)
(Uncle mute)
(All scream)
All: What?
"Jade: Oh, no! I'm a mule! A stubborn mule!"
Jackie: My head--it's huge!
"Tohru, mother's voice: I'm turning into my mother."
(Uncle claps)
Jade: It's like somebody hit uncle's mute button.
Tohru: Ah. Sometimes wishes do come true.
Jackie: (Gasps) The mirror spirits--
they're making our worst fears about ourselves come true!
"Everybody out! Go, go, go!"
(Jackie strains)
(Tohru grunts)
Jackie: Something tells me I'm fortunate
I did not hear that.
"Aw, uncle, please stop staring and tell us"
how to remove the mirror spirits from inside us.
"Jade: Hey, I kind of like uncle this way."
Hee-haw!
At least I'm not a mime.
Why don't you walk against the wind or something?
"Jackie: Aw! All right, both of you!"
You're giving me a headache-- a big one!
don't even think about it.
"Here, uncle."
"Whatever you know, write it down."
Tohru: This is nonsense!
Just like everything that used to come out of your mouth!
Jackie: Wait! This is the scroll I picked up inside the temple.
Maybe it will tell us something.
Tohru: It says that the mirror spirits
"not only mutate their human hosts,"
"but that the hosts can then spread the fear and chaos simply by touch,"
moving from one person to the next and so on.
Throughout the world!
Jackie: (Gasps) So how do we stop them?
Tohru: Patience! Unless spirits are expelled from hosts
"and recaptured in the mirror with a binding spell,"
the mutations will become permanent!
Jade: Permanent?!
Jackie: We have a piece of the mirror.
That's a good start. What about the spell?
Tohru: It is not on the scroll.
Jade: Either uncle knows the spell or he has to use the bathroom.
"Uh, I know! Act it out, uncle, like in charades!"
"Jackie: Oh, the mountain temple!"
Jade: We need to go to a bullfight?
Jackie: Antennae! We need some kind of bug?
Tohru: The junk man dances like sick chicken.
"Jackie: Unh, uncle, please, stay focused!"
Jade: A cricket?
"It's got to be a cricket from the mountain temple, right?"
Jade: Yes!
"Jackie: Is that all, uncle?"
"Yes, I know my head is as big as that statue!"
Very kind of you to point that out.
Jade: - You want us to get something from the top of the statue?
"Jackie: Oh, ok, sounds like..."
Jade: Throw!
Jackie: Hurl! Fling! Toss!
Jade: Sounds like toss?
Tohru: - You toss like a little girl!
Jackie: Yaah! Stop it!
"We do not have time for your bickering, tohru!"
"Uh, tohru's mom! Oh, forget it!"
Boss? Cross? Floss?
Aaah! Oh!
Uggh! Moss?
We need moss from the top of the ghost king's statue!
"Jackie: Ooh! Bad day, bad day, bad day!"
Spirit #2: Hee hee hee!
Yeow! Unh!
"Jade: Hey, Jackie!"
Jackie: Jade? How did you get up here?
Jade: Duh!
Took the tram.
"I'm stubborn, not stupid."
Tohru: Why you overpay for rusty old cricket cage?
I did much better job
negotiating - new headphones for Jade.
(Cricket chirping)
(Tohru laughs)
Tohru: You call that cricket catching?
You couldn't catch a cold!
Boy: You're so greedy!
Brother: Stop being so jealous all the time!
Boy: Am not!
"Brother: Are, too! Aah!"
"Man: Ohh, - I was afraid of this."
I knew I shouldn't have had szechuan chicken for lunch.
"Ohh, bad heartburn!"
"Man: Hey, get away from my cart!"
"Ohh, feels like my stomach's on fire!"
"Jade: Hee-haw! Jackie, look!"
There's the moss uncle needs for the spell!
Jackie: Ohhh!
"Jade: Whoa there, humpty dumpty."
"Here, I better do it. Give me a boost."
Jackie: Ooh! Watch where you're stepping!
"Jade: I would, but I can't see anything"
with your overstuffed <i>cabesa</i> in the way.
Almost got it!
Uh-oh!
(Braying)
"Jackie: Aah, Jade! Watch where you're kicking!"
"Jade: Please, Jackie, hold still!"
Got it!
Both: Whoa!
Aah!
Both: Aaaaaah!
Unh!
Both: Whew!
Both: Aah!
Unh!
Ohhhh!
Unh!
"Jackie: Unh! - Jade, are you all right?"
Jade: I think I swallowed the moss. Ptoo!
"Oh, no, wait! There it is! Hee-haw!"
"Tohru: Ha! In your face, junk seller!"
Tohru: Now you're going to throw a tantrum?
What?!
Tohru: Aah!
Jackie: Uncle!
Jackie: The mirror spirits are spreading their fear!
You weren't supposed to touch anyone!
"Jade: If they reach the mainland, they'll infect the whole city!"
"And then who knows? Like, all of China?"
Jade: Nothing's happening.
Tohru: That's because the old windbag is nothing but wind!
(Mumbling)
"Jackie: Uncle, please, this is no time to fight!"
"Jade: No, listen!"
Uncle's moving tohru's lips to chant the binding spell!
(Tohru chanting)
Spirit #2: Ohhh!
Spirit #1: Yaiii!
Lead spirit: Roarrr!
Spirit #3: Baaah!
"Tohru: Uh, <i> sensei,</i> àwhile I was my mother,"
"uh, well, I'm sorry."
"Uncle: Not now, tohru! Jackie, the mirror!"
(All screaming)
(All grunt)
Spirit #2: What are we going to do?
Lead spirit: Do not fear!
Below us lies our passage to freedom!
The world will be ours
and chaos will reign for all eternity!
(All laughing)
"Uncle: Jackie, mirror spirits must not reach ship!"
"Jackie: But the mirror shard, it's gone!"
"Jade: Uncle, will the binding spell work with anything that reflects?"
Uncle: It is possible. Why?
Jade: Jackie!
(Uncle chanting)
Jackie: The disk must be full.
We need more reflective objects!
Tohru: What? My mom left it behind during her last trip.
(Uncle chanting)
Spirit #2: Owww!
Spirit #3: Aaah!
"Jade: 3 down, 1 to go!"
"Go, Jackie! Go, Jackie!"
All: Aaaah!
Jackie: Ohh!
(Gasping)
Lead spirit: You're too late!
"Jade: Oh, yeah? Well, in your face, mirror boy!"
Lead spirit: Aah!
"Jade: But, hey, I guess I'm just stubborn that way."
Jackie: These will be safe back at section 13.
Jade: Too bad we can't come back to fengdo.
This place turned out to be a lot more exiting than I thought it'd be.
"Sorry, uncle, I guess I should have been listening."
"Jackie: Me, too."
Uncle: Apologies accepted.
But tohru is another story!
Mirror spirits turn you into mother
"is no excuse for the way you talk to uncle,"
especially when nobody can hear uncle's snappy comebacks!
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, did you have any imaginary friends as a child?"
"Jackie: Actually, I don't."
Especially when I was in the school.
"We had, like, a hundred students."
"We sleep together, we eat together,"
"we play, - we're training together,"
"so I actually don't,"
because of so many martial artist sisters and brothers.
"Jackie: Hello, my reptilian friend."
Aah!
"Aah. Unh. Aah, aah."
Bad day.
Waaah!
Jackie: Waaah!
Unh! Unh!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
So sorry.
"Vanessa: Remember us, chan?"
"You snatched the nebilla opal,"
"the sword of badang,"
and now the silver iguana of yorumba
right out of our greedy little hands.
"Jackie: Yes, heh. Nice to see you all again, heh heh."
How've you been? Heh.
Bye-bye.
"Unh, ho!"
Aah!
Waah!
Jackie: Heh heh. Pleasant day for a hike.
Jade: Jackie!
Welcome aboard Jade airlines.
Jade: And that's how we returned the silver iguana
to the museum of yorumba.
Comic fans: Cool.
Larry: Wow.
I wish I could go on an adventure.
Scott: You could start
by movin' out of your mom's basement.
(Laughs)
"Jade: Come on, Larry."
You're going to the super duper convention this weekend.
"That's exciting, right?"
Larry: Duh. Everyone who's anyone in comics
is gonna be there.
"But just once, I wanna go to the con"
with a story like the silver iguana of yorumba.
I wanna be a hero like super moose or you...
Or Jackie.
Jackie: Oh ho. Hero.
You've been listening to too many of Jade's stories.
"Jade: I know how you feel, dude. Larry: Ow!"
Jade: Jackie tries - to leave me out of the action
all the time.
Larry: But you don't take no for an answer.
You go after what you want.
"Jade: You could do the same thing, Larry."
Be like super moose.
Free the hero inside.
Larry: Ah. I don't know if there's a hero in there.
(Rumbling)
Uncle: Earthquake.
(Gasps)
Demon chi is loose!
The demon chi is still near.
Tohru and I will repair the containment unit
while you find all 5 missing demon powers.
"Tohru: Remember, the chi-o-matic holds"
only one power at a time.
You must come back to the containment unit
after capturing each one.
Jackie: Ow! Jade: Hey!
Uncle: Evil does not sleep!
Captain black: I'll put on some coffee.
(Jade gasps) Chi at 12 o'clock high!
"Jade: Good aim, Tex!"
Jade: Gotcha.
(Captain black snoring)
"Uncle: Water, moon, sky, wind."
(Jade yawns) - Now back to snoozeville.
Uncle: Aiyaah! - Earth demon chi is not here!
Tohru: Mmm. The chi-o-matic does not detect the power
within section 13.
"(Drago snores, grunts)"
"(Ice, fist, cobra snoring)"
(Clanging)
Strikemaster ice: What? Yaa?
"Yo, why you gotta wake me up, dawg?"
My dream was off the hook!
Drago: We have work to do.
"Kids: Yeah! Watch out, man! Whoo! Whoo!"
Larry: How am I ever gonna free my inner hero?
(Sighs) Maybe I should read
some <i> super moose</i> àback issues.
Larry: Hey! Watch it! Whoa!
Oof!
(Larry shivers)
Tingly.
(Larry gasps) Lizard men!
Just like in <i> astonishing</i> à <i> moose tales number 157!</i>
Drago: You have something I want.
"And what I want, I take!"
"Strikemaster ice: What's the dilly, yo?"
"Drago: He's using the power of dai gui,"
the earth demon!
Larry: Aah!
Mc cobra: Huh? Ooh!
Larry: Bleah! Bleah! Wh--what's goin' on?
Larry: Please-- please don't hurt me!
(Rumbles)
Strikemaster ice: I'm so gonna burn your crust!
You know what I'm sayin'? (Inhales)
Strikemaster ice: Unh! Ooh!
Larry: Unh! Ow.
Drago: Playtime's over.
Drago: Aah!
"Jade: Step back, lizard lips."
"Larry, you have the earth demon chi?"
"Drago: don't worry, little missy."
He won't have it for long!
Jade: Leave my friend alone!
(Ice crew grunting)
Drago: Why are these fools still breathing?!
Tohru: Whooaaahh!
(Crash)
"Jade: Larry, listen--"
you have these weirdo powers
because some demon chi got into your body.
Larry: Demons? Ha!
There's no such thing.
"Uh, fire breathing lizard men, maybe."
But not demons.
"Ok, I'm outta here!"
"Jade: Larry, wait!"
"Drago: Let's go, boys!"
The chi's gone underground.
Jade: We gotta go after Larry!
Jackie: No. The tunnel could collapse with you inside.
Tohru: Jade is right. We must find Larry before drago does.
"Uncle: And before evil chi corrupts Larry's own chi,"
turning him into a demon.
Larry: Something's definitely different.
That stuff I did with the ground
and these...Muscles.
I--I have super powers!
I've finally unlocked the hero within!
"(Dog pants, barks)"
Larry: But - these new powers mean
I have great responsibility. Yes.
It's time--time to fulfill my destiny!
"Strikemaster ice: - Yo, we would've had that chi"
if you hadn't tried that inverted 720 off the vert ramp.
Fist: Whoa!
"Strikemaster ice: Whoa, hey, unh!"
Drago: Quiet!
That earth demon chi is still out there.
"We're going to find it, take it, and bury chan!"
Jade: This is where the comic shop owner said Larry lives.
"Jackie: Thank you, Jade. I will take it from..."
Larry's mom: Yes?
"Jade: Uh, hi. Can Larry come out and play?"
Larry's mom: Lawrence is trying on his new costume.
"He's going to fulfill his destiny, you know."
Come in.
(Rumbling)
Jackie: We are too late!
Uncle: Very strong reading.
Demon chi - must be above ground!
Jade: I hope Larry's not doing anything crazy.
Larry: This is my city: San Francisco--
the city I've sworn to protect.
I am...Uh...
"I, uh, ooh."
Spectacu-Larry!
(Mayor speaking)
Vandal: The mayor doesn't deserve a statue!
Vandal: We're here to show his true colors!
(Rumbling)
Vandals: Aah!
"Larry: Spectacu-Larry at your service, mayor!"
No need to thank me.
It's all in a day's work for the seismic superhero.
Larry: Nothing bad happens to art
on the amazing spectacu-Larry's watch.
"Larry: It's back to the big house for you,"
compliments of the stupendous spectacu-Larry!
Can ya dig it?
(Sirens)
Jade: We're getting warmer.
Uncle: Not warm enough!
"Jackie: Rather than trying to catch up to Larry,"
perhaps we should attempt to get ahead of him.
Tohru: Where would a superhero go?
Jade: I know!
(People chattering)
Jade: Cool!
Uncle: We must hurry.
Split up and look for teenager in a costume!
Jackie: That is everyone here.
Uncle: Do not argue with uncle!
Jackie: Ooh!
Krampon warrior Scott: Nok-cha! Blork gup-ta!
"Jackie: Uh, excuse me?"
Krampon warrior Scott: You have offended our honor!
You must apologize!
"Jackie: Ooh, I am sorry."
Krampon warrior Scott: In our language!
Tohru: Oh.
<i>Sumo girl</i> was - my favorite show growing up.
"Sumo girl: Mine, too."
"(Giggles) What's your name, big boy?"
"Tohru: Eh, uh, uh, I must keep searching."
Sumo girl: A man on a mission. Ooh.
I like that.
"Lisa: Ok, I'm attacking your wizard with my swordsman."
Danny: My wizard casts a melting spell.
Your sword is slag! Ha!
Uncle: Aiyaa!
Magic must defeat magic!
Up! Up!
You want a piece of uncle?
(Jade gasps) - <i>Super moose number one!</i>
Jade: I'll give you 20 bucks.
"Booth owner: Ha! Are you kiddin', kid?"
"It's worth 10 times that, easy."
(Rumbling)
Larry: Behold! Spectacu-Larry!
"Jackie: Ah, Larry, please, you are not a superhero!"
"Jade: Yeah, you have all these powers"
because the demon chi is taking control of you!
"Larry: You're wrong, Jade!"
I know what's happening!
"I'm, uh, I'm..."
I'm turning into super moose!
Drago: What you're turning into
is a major pain in my tail!
"Krampon warrior Scott: Dude, weak costume."
I could totally see the latex.
"Jackie: Tohru, do you have the chi-o-matic?"
"Tohru: No, uncle was carrying it."
Jackie: Find uncle.
We will try to keep drago from absorbing the demon chi.
"Jade: But, uh--"
(drago growling)
Jackie: Waah!
All: Unh!
"(All cheer, applaud)"
"Jackie: Aah! Hot, hot, hot!"
Jade: How about I go find uncle?
"Larry: Nice block, Larry-lad!"
Now let a real hero do his job!
Larry-lad?
(Drago growls)
My hero ain't nothin' but a sandwich...
Mama's boy.
Larry: ¶ do do do do do ¶
antler action!
"Larry: You are more powerful than I expected, villains."
But spectacu-Larry has mights to spare!
(Drago screams)
Aah!
"Jackie: Aah! Please, do not touch the celebrity guest!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, we ain't playin' dress up, mama's boy."
Ice crew: Hywaah!
Tohru: Rrrah!
Larry: Who wants spectacu-Larry's autograph?
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, it's time to make this big chunkie"
into a lot of little chunkies.
Ice crew: Unh!
Sumo girl: May I join you?
"Tohru: Oh, by all means."
Danny: My plus-3 elvish sword paralyzes your cleric ranger!
"Uncle: Ah, but - my cleric ranger has a..."
Uncle: Blowfish.
(Danny gasps) (Crowd laughs)
(Jade panting) Uncle! Jackie...Larry...
Uncle: In a minute! Uncle is busy kicking Booty!
Jade: Drago...Demon chi...
(Uncle sighs) - Uncle will be right back.
Do not touch uncle's cards.
(All yelling)
Jackie: Larry! Stop!
"Larry, earth demon voice: Stand aside, Larry-lad,"
while I eradicate these evildoers!
Larry: Huh?
Jackie: Unh!
(Rumbling)
(All yelling)
"Larry: You raise your hand against me, Larry-lad?!"
I'm the hero!
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao...
Larry: What trickery is this?
"Jade: He's taking away your powers, Larry. It's for your own good."
Larry: I thought I could trust you.
But you have betrayed me!
All: Aah!
Larry: Once my friends...
Now my enemies!
Uncle: His transformation into earth demon dai gui
is nearly complete!
Jade: No! Larry's still in there!
I know I can reach him! I know it!
"Hey, uh, spectacu-Larry!"
This isn't how a superhero acts.
"Larry: How do <i> you</i> know, Jade?"
You're not a superhero!
Jade: No. But I've read a lot of <i> super moose</i> comics
just like you.
Remember <i> the terrible traps</i> à <i> of the toilet master?</i>
Larry: <i> Spectacular</i> à <i> super moose number 39.</i>
Jade: Super moose's mind was taken over
by the toilet master who turned him against the animal avengers.
But when super moose remembered
"to trust the hero inside,"
he was able to save the day.
Larry: Hero...Inside...
"Jade: Look around you, Larry."
Would super moose trash this place
and scare everyone?
Is this acting like the hero inside?
Larry: What have I done?
Jade: It's not you. It's the demon chi. We can help you.
Larry: Mustn't give in... To demon.
"Still a hero...Inside,"
and his name...Is... Larry.
"Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao,"
"yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao,"
yu-mo-gue-guai- fie-Dee-tsao.
Larry: Aaahhh!
Jade: Larry! You ok?
"Larry, normal voice: I--I think so."
I feel all tingly.
(Booth owners grumbling)
"Booth owner: Hey, who's gonna pay for this damage?"
Jackie: Wait! No. I didn't...
It wasn't...
Uncle: Uncle is new grand master wizard!
Sumo girl: Call me.
Sumo girl: Mmmph! - We'll go out for a big lunch.
(Tohru laughs)
"Jade: Come on, Larry. Let's..."
Hey! How much?
"Booth owner: Go ahead, take it, kid."
It's worthless now.
Jade: Not to me.
"Jackie: After all we went through,"
you want more comics?
Jade: Tch. Not just any comic.
"Scott: Could you sign it, ""to my best pal?"""
"Jade: Hey, Larry."
"Larry: Jade, ya made it!"
Check it out.
Jade: <i> The adventures</i> à <i> of spectacu-Larry</i>
<i>with his sidekick larr-ina.</i>
Jackie: What about Larry-lad?
"Jade: Awesome! Hey, I have a million story ideas."
How about larr-ina saves the city?
"No, wait, the world! Stay with me here."
Dragon-boy and the lizard men - shoot a missile into the sun
to turn the earth into a reptile's only desert planet!
Spectacu-Larry tries to stop 'em.
"But he gets captured, so it's up to larr-ina"
to get the self-destruct code before it's too late.
"Oh, and larr-ina should be able to fly,"
and how about X-ray vision?
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, what do you do to relax?"
"Jackie: When I relax,"
"I have, like, a loft,"
and I call up some friends.
"We sit down, listen to music,"
"watch TV, yeah."
"Because from TV, I can learn so many things."
Uncle: Ah...Ah...Ah...
(Sneezes)
Jackie!
"Jackie: Yes, uncle."
"Uncle: More hot tea, please!"
"Jackie: Yes, uncle. I have already put the kettle on."
Uncle: One more thing... (Sniffles)
Uncle's toes are chilly!
One more thing!
Uncle needs more cold and flu season garlic!
"Jackie, groaning: Ohh...More garlic?"
(Kettle whistles)
Uncle: Jackie! I hear water boiling!
What is hold-up?
"Jackie: I am getting your garlic, uncle."
"Jade, perhaps you could--"
"Jade: Sorry, uncle Jackie."
"Love to help, but I gotta take care of the customers."
Tohru!
"(Humming, music in headphones)"
Uncle: Jackieeee!
"Jackie: Coming, uncle!"
Ah...Uh...Aah!
"(Sighs) Here you are, uncle."
Is there anything else you need?
Uncle: Yes. Rest.
(Jackie exhales)
Stop making noise!
(Ding-ding-ding-ding)
One more thing.
"Jackie: Yes, uncle?"
Uncle: Another demon power has been released.
Jade: Cool!
Uncle: Aaiii-yaahh!
"It is tchangzu, the thunder demon,"
defeated in ancient times by magic castanets.
"Jade: Castanets, huh?"
"Sounds like a road trip. Spain, Mexico?"
Jackie: The bottom of the ocean.
It is a sunken ship.
And there are letters on the hull.
Jade: A-n-I-c.
Whoa! The castanets went down with...The <i> Titanic!</i>
"Jade: What do you mean, it's not the <i> Titanic?</i> Àthe name on the hull--"
black: Ends with a-n-I-c.
It's the <i> oceanic.</i>
Sank in the arctic waters in 1932.
"According to the passenger manifest,"
there was a troop - of flamenco dancers on board.
No doubt used the castanets in their act.
"Jade: The <i> Titanic, oceanic.</i> Àpotato, pot-ahto."
"It's still deep-sea salvage, and that is mondo coolio!"
"Jackie: It is mondo dangerous, Jade."
The ship sits at the bottom of an icy ocean.
"Black: Fortunately, section 13 has a new submersible vehicle,"
especially designed for... (Sniffs)
What is that odor? Smells like...
(Jackie sniffs)
Jackie: Uncle.
"Tohru: I pleaded with <i> sensei</i> àto stay in bed,"
but he would not listen.
Uncle: Uncle is needed. Demon chi is very powerful.
Black: Oh! So is that garlic.
Strikemaster ice: Y'all ready to shred?
Mc cobra: Tahoe is gonna be off the hook! Yeah!
Drago: And where do you three snow bunnies think you're off to?
"Strikemaster ice: Gonna bust a move on some fresh powder, dawg."
Drago: Wrong answer...Dawg.
All three: Yo!
"Strikemaster ice: A'ight. I feel ya, d."
You vibin' on some new demon chi?
"Drago: Big time. The power of thunder,"
contained in a pair of immortal castanets.
"Strikemaster ice: Castanets, huh? Ole!"
So where they gonna be at--cabo?
Mc cobra: Sweet! Yeah. We could catch some primo rays.
Drago: The castanets are under water.
(Shudders) Not exactly my cup of chi.
"Strikemaster ice: Why you say that, d.?"
don't tell me you're scared of a little surf.
Drago: Scared? No.
I just dislike being under water
because then I can't <i> do this!</i>
Just because I won't be going on this little sea hunt
doesn't mean you three can't.
You'll need a submarine.
"Strikemaster ice: A sub? See, now, that's kinda tricky, yo."
Mc cobra: Not like we're gonna find one
with the key still in the ignition.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, ho, ho! Hold up, chief!"
My boy dj fist's got a bright one.
Jade: Whoa!
That is one kean-o submarine-o.
Black: Section 13's newest prototype.
"Able to withstand 3,000 tons of pressure,"
"lateral maneuverability, retractable pincer arms."
"Jade: Well, what are you landlubbers waiting for?"
Let's shape up and ship out.
"Jackie: You are not going, Jade."
Jade: Jackie! I saw the movie <i>Titanic</i> 12 times!
That makes me a total expert on sunken treasure.
Uncle: Jade must listen to Jackie.
You cannot go on sub with us!
"Jackie: And neither can you, uncle."
Not with your cold.
"All those germs in a tiny, enclosed space..."
Ow!
Uncle: Uncle is not infectious! Ah-choo!
And you cannot perform removal spell yourself!
"Jackie: I realize that, uncle."
"But tohru and I can retrieve the castanets,"
and you can perform the removal spell later on dry land.
Black: Makes sense.
Uncle and Jade: Ohh...
Drago: Well?
"Strikemaster ice: It's all good, dawg."
We got everything we need.
Drago: You have a submarine in there?
"Strikemaster ice: Naw, we got tools."
Cobra and fist gonna build you one.
Drago: I wouldn't trust those two to mow my lawn!
"(Clanking, drilling)"
"Strikemaster ice: Word up, d. These two got mad skills!"
Drago: They're gonna have mad scars if--
mc cobra: Somebody order a sub?
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, that is one sweet ride."
"Come on, d. Give my boys some props!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, got it. Keepin' it low-key."
"Black: All right, Jackie."
Brace yourselves for splashdown.
"Jackie: Balance, tohru."
Tohru: Jackie?
"Jackie, muffled: Ohh..."
Are we there yet?
"Maintain course, tohru."
I believe the <i> oceanic</i> àis directly below us.
"(Sniff, sniff)"
What is that odor?
"(Sniff, sniff)"
"Jade: Hi, Jackie."
Jackie: Jade...
"Jade: I know, I know. Too dangerous."
"But you need me, uncle Jackie."
"Ok, fine. I'll leave."
Jackie: Very funny!
"We are 20,000 leagues under the sea, and--"
"(sniff, sniff)"
Oh! Why do you smell like garlic?
Jade: Not me.
It's coming from...
"Uncle: Hi, Jackie."
Jackie: Uncle!
Jade: Great minds think alike.
Uncle: Wipe sourpuss off face!
Uncle is not infectious!
Now get uncle a blanket. It's freezing in sub!
"Strikemaster ice: - Drop-zone dead ahead, homies."
"Yo, fist, drago say east or west of the glacier?"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, we don't ski till we get the chi."
You feel me?
"Jackie: Tohru, you must drive more carefully!"
Tohru: I do not understand.
There are no rock formations in this area.
"Jade: Uh, Jackie?"
Uncle: Aiiii-yaaaah!
Giant crab monster!
Jade: I never thought I'd be on this end of a submarine sandwich.
"Jade: Oh, uncle! Isn't there some kind of"
"""crab be gone"" mojo you can do?"
"Uncle: Magic must defeat magic, not overgrown shellfish!"
"Jackie: You are right, uncle!"
Crab must defeat crab!
"(Jackie, uncle, tohru, Jade yelling)"
(Lobster screeches)
Tohru: Oh...I fear we are only making him angrier.
Jade: Let's see how you do against a video game pro.
"Hang right, crew. We're about to experience a little turbulence!"
(Screeches)
Make a wish.
Yes! He's crab cakes now!
Uncle: Aiii-yaaah!
Jackie gasps: It is the <i> oceanic!</i>
"Jade: Come on, slowpoke."
"Jackie: Jade, you are staying inside the sub."
Jade: Ohh...
Jackie: It is an enormous ship.
Finding the castanets among the wreckage will not be easy.
Uncle: So use chi-o-matic!
Jackie: Under water?
Uncle: Baggie seals in freshness.
"(Metal creaks, shifts)"
Jackie: Ow!
"But uncle, we found the immortal castanets!"
Uncle: Yes. And chi-o-matic is soaked like overcooked noodle!
Cannot do removal spell until it is dry! (Sub engine struggles)
"Tohru: I believe we may have a bigger problem, <i> sensei.</i>"
Uncle: I know! Uncle is running out of garlic!
Tohru: No. I'm afraid our submarine is not rising to the surface.
Jackie: Hmm. It must have been damaged by the giant crab.
We will have to jettison some weight.
Tohru: I'm sorry. I am not a very good swimmer.
Jade: No prob. I'll go.
"Jackie: No, you will not, Jade."
I will go.
Jade: Fine! But only because you weigh more--
a lot more! A whole lot--
uncle: Jackie!
Do not surface too quickly or you will get the bends.
Jade: He gets a German luxury car?
"Jackie: No, Jade. The bends is a condition"
that occurs when a diver rises too quickly.
"Tohru: I have heard that the pressure change can cause wooziness,"
"delirium, or worse."
"Jackie: Yes. I will swim very, very slowly."
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, peep this, dawgs."
The man with the castanets.
"After we get them clackers, we can leave chan to sleep with the fishes."
"Mc cobra: Oh, that's whacked. You lost him, bro!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, chan must have booked for the surface."
But it's all good. We'll be waitin'.
Jade gasps: Jackie!
Uncle: Aaiii-yaah!
Uncle told him not to swim quickly!
Nephew never listens.
(Jackie grunts)
"Luckily, I avoided betting the gends."
I--hee hee hee!
I mean I--ooh!
Ground is all wobbly like pudding!
I like tapioca.
Jade: Ooh! Can't this crate move any faster?
"Tohru: Unfortunately, no."
Uncle: Jackie can take care of himself.
"Right now, it is uncle who needs help."
Chi-o-matic must be bone-dry to operate properly.
Tohru: Perhaps you can use this.
Jade: You brought a hair dryer on a deep-sea mission?
Tohru: Ocean air gives me the frizzies.
Strikemaster ice: Let's do some thrashin'!
"Jackie: Hello, neighbors. Nice day."
"Strikemaster ice: Oh, yeah!"
Nice day to bust open a can of whoop-chan!
"Jackie: Oh, pretty!"
You made a snow angel.
"Strikemaster ice: Get him, yo!"
Jackie: We play Patty cake?
"Strikemaster ice: All right, fool. Enough reindeer games."
Hand over the castanets.
Jackie: Cast a net? Oh! We go fishing?
I like fishies!
"Strikemaster ice: - Chan, you feelin' all right?"
Jackie: Peachy keen.
Jade: Come on! We gotta find Jackie!
"Uncle: Uncle will stay here,"
finish styling chi-o-matic.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, got me a burnin' desire"
"for those castanets, chan."
Jackie: Ooh! Pretty fireworks.
Is it Chinese new year already?
Jade: Didn't anyone ever tell you smoking's bad for your health?
"Strikemaster ice: Shrimp, you headed for the Barbie."
Jackie: Oh ho! We play freeze tag?
You are it.
"Jade: Avalanche, comin' at ya."
"Tohru: Jackie, are you all right?"
"Jackie: Yes, but you two are very wobbly."
Wobbly is a funny word.
Rhymes with gobbly. Hee he.
Jade: He has so got the bends.
Jackie: I do? What a nice car!
Yay for me!
"Oh! Hello again, buddy!"
Jade: Charge!
Uncle: <i> Yu mo guai guey</i> à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>
Ah-choo!
<i>Yu mo guai guey</i> à <i> fi de tsao...</i>
"Drago: Crunchy metal outside,"
gooey chi filling inside.
Uncle: You want a piece of uncle?
Drago: Gonna be several pieces of uncle when I'm through!
Uncle: Eeeeaaaaah!
Jackie: Hee hee! Look at the flying old man!
"Jade: Climb aboard, t. I'll steer."
"Tohru: We're coming, <i> sensei.</i>"
Uncle: Take your time! No hurry.
Jackie: Wheeee!
(Drago growls)
Drago: Anyone up for some flame-enco dancing?
"And now, for the main attraction..."
Uncle: Aiii-yaah!
"Drago is absorbing power of tchangzu,"
the thunder demon!
Jackie: Ooh! Pretty.
"Drago, as Elvis: Tchangzu. Tchangzu very much."
And don't even think about following me.
"Much as I'd love to stay and chill,"
I'll leave that to you.
Jackie: A skating rink. Fun!
"Jade: Well, this turned out well."
"Drago gets the thunder power,"
we're stuck in the middle of the ocean on a melting chunk of ice...
(Sniffs) And somebody <i>so</i> needs a breath mint!
Tohru: And it appears that a storm is brewing.
Black: Need a lift?
Jackie: Whirly-birdy!
Black: Jackie has a bad case of the bends.
Needs to decompress for 48 hours.
Same for uncle.
Uncle: Let uncle out!
Jade: Poor guy. Totally delusional.
"Tohru: I do not understand, Jade."
Why did you tell captain black that <i> sensei</i> had the bends?
Jade: You kidding? That garlic smell was making me gag!
"I figure, 2 days in solitary,"
"good-bye, major stink."
Uncle: Let uncle out! Aaiiii-yaaah!
Jackie: I hear knock-knock. Who's there?
Hee hee. I like monkeys.
And wax lips.
This is a nice phone booth.
"Ooh, look, I can make funny sounds with my underarms!"
Hee hee hee hee! Oop--'scuse me.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, do you like to surf the web?"
Jackie: I want to surf something I want to surf.
I'm not like...
How do you say? Surf the whole day.
"Lotta people just-- nothing to do, just surf, surf."
"No, I just surf one thing. The things I want to know I surf."
Then after that I leave.
Jade: Previously on <i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>
"Uncle: It is t'changzu, the thunder demon!"
Drago: And now for the main attraction!
Uncle: Aiyaah!
Drago's absorbing power of t'changzu!
Drago: Now that I possess the thunder chi of t'changzu
"and my own fire chi,"
there will be no stopping me.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, you're going down, clown!"
"Mc cobra: Yeah, you wish."
Be droppin' you like a bad habit.
Yo!
Drago: Now do I have your attention?
Strikemaster ice: - This dude needs to chill.
Drago: Grr!
"Mc cobra: S'not really convertible weather, d-man."
Drago: Time to dump this dump.
Tohru: I hate rain.
Uncle: Quiet.
Chi-o-matic senses presence of duel demon chi.
Drago must be near.
"Jade: So let's throw 'em a little surprise party,"
chan style.
"Jackie: Jade, I told you to stay by the car."
Jade: Hello! You didn't say which car.
(Tohru shudders)
Drago: Sounds like we have junkyard rats.
Time to put you all out of my misery.
All: Aah!
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, it's time to throw down."
"Uncle: Jackie, must get closer to remove thunder demon chi"
from snotty-nosed dragon!
Uncle needs distraction.
"Jade: Nice timing, t."
"Mc cobra: Yo, girlfriend."
You disrespectin' my hizz-ouse.
Jade: My bad. I meant to dis you!
Mc cobra: Ha ha ha!
"You can run, but you can't hide."
(Jade imitates buzzer) Wrong!
Jade: Peek-a-boo!
Jackie: Bwaaa!
"Strikemaster ice: You're way out of your league, gramps."
Uncle: Smarty-pants teenager want a piece of gramps?
Strikemaster ice: Ha ha ha!
Jade: Up high.
Down low.
Mc cobra: Too slow.
Drago: 2 chans for the price of one.
"Jade: Uh, how come scale face isn't cooked cajun-style?"
Uncle: Thunder demon chi has allowed drago
to absorb storm's power!
Drago: Rraah!
(Horns honking)
Jackie: Find something that won't conduct drago's lightning.
The tires!
"Strikemaster ice: Ho ho ho! Epic light show, d-dude."
(Mc cobra coughs) Whoa.
They gotta be charcoal briquettes under there.
Drago: Let's go. It's moving day.
Jackie: Is everyone all right?
Uncle: Aiyaah! Uncle not all right!
"The longer punk demon possesses thunder demon chi,"
the more difficult it will be for uncle to remove!
"Drew: Oh, yeah."
Float like a butterfly. Sting like a--
right jab! Right jab!
"Ha! When I'm through,"
you're gonna be nothing but spare parts!
"Jade: Dream on, tin man."
Drew: Have a nice trip.
Winner and still robomercs champion.
"Learn from the master, young one."
"Jade: T'ch, right."
"Rematch, drew. Now."
It wouldn't be fair.
"Face it, Jade, - you need a lot more practice."
Uncle: Creating fire chi removal spell is
a very difficult task.
Only much Patience and concentration
will yield success.
"Jade: Please, please, please, please, please."
I'll do all my chores.
Jackie: You'll do all your chores regardless.
"Jade: Uncle Jackie,"
I'm like the only kid in the world
who doesn't have robomercs.
Jackie: Ohh.
Video games will distract you from your studies.
Jade: That's not true!
"Program in your mondo cool sayings,"
that's creative writing.
"Keeping score, that's math."
"Honestly, robomercs is more educational than homework."
Jackie: We will see.
Jade: Translation: Fuggedtaboutit.
Tohru: Perhaps a drop of black widow saliva.
"Uncle: Tohru, no!"
Aiyaah!
Does uncle's shop look waterproof?!
Tohru: Ohh.
"Security guard: Keep it movin', boys."
Building's closed for renovations.
Drago: Right. Ours.
Security guard: Uhh!
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, major d.,"
why don't you let me and the posse
trick out your new digs?
Drago: As long as it doesn't interfere with my plans.
Strikemaster ice: Sweet.
Capt. Black: This was taken by a surveillance camera
at pacific steel outside of Seattle.
"Sheet metal, steel girders, cast-iron pipes."
And that's not all.
Similar crimes have been reported throughout the area.
"Roller coaster cars,"
"a prefab swimming pool,"
even the sound system at sea breeze stadium.
Jade: Talk about your shop till you drop.
Jackie: But why is strikemaster ice stealing
those particular items?
"Capt. Black: <i>No se, compadre.</i>"
"But, I'll bet where there's ice, there's a fire demon."
"Tohru: It is very gray here,"
"very, very gray."
"Jade: Cheer up, big t. It's Seattle,"
"home of grunge rock, mega-mocha grandes, and--"
"Jackie: And soon the thunderstorm of the century,"
if the weather reports are correct.
"Tohru: Grr. Jackie: Oh, sorry."
"Jade: Come on, t. I'm treating."
What'll you have?
"Tohru: Hmm. Double mocha latte,"
"or chocochino steamed Espresso,"
or double decaf half-caff with a twist?
Uncle: Hot <i> cha!</i> À coffee is coffee!
"Police radio: All units, robbery in progress."
Clarksman aircraft manufacturing.
"3 youths on skateboards, appear armed and dangerous,"
possibly using some sort of flamethrower.
"Jackie: Ice. Tohru: No, thank you."
I prefer my coffee piping hot.
"Jade: Your attention, please."
This flight has been grounded.
Strikemaster ice: I thought we put you dawgs to sleep.
Mc cobra: Ha ha ha!
Uncle: Uhh!
Jade hyah!
Jackie: Where is drago?
"Strikemaster ice: Kickin' it in his new digs, where else?"
"Love to stay and jaw,"
but we've burned too much daylight as it is.
Peace!
Jade: That's one way to get more legroom.
(Whooshing)
(Whooshing)
Jackie: Uhh!
Bwaaa!
Dj fist: Uhh!
Jade: Ooh. That's gonna leave a mark.
Strikemaster ice: We outta here.
"Jade: Uncle Jackie, they're getting away!"
"Jackie: Jade, what are you doing?!"
Jade: Is this a trick question?
"Strikemaster ice: One chan ka-Bob, coming up!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, d."
Check out the windage we snagged.
Jade: Gotcha!
Jackie: Jade!
"Jade: I really gotta work on that ""look before you leap"" thing."
Jackie: Drago could have taken Jade anywhere in the city.
Uncle: No. Drago came to Seattle with a purpose.
"Discover purpose, and Jade's location becomes clear."
Tohru: He certainly did not come to Seattle
for the weather.
Jackie: Perhaps he did.
"Uncle: Jackie, explain."
Jackie: Drago's power was magnified
when he was struck by the lightning
"at the junkyard, so--"
tohru: So his new lair would be easily accessible
to the power of Seattle's frequent thunderstorms.
"Uncle: One more thing,"
taller is better for lightning rods.
Jade: No way.
Drago's new crib is the space needle?
Jade: So this is what all those freaky robberies were about.
(Whooshing)
Jade: This place rocks!
Mc cobra: Waah! Ooh! Aah!
Jade: Whoa. Life-sized robomercs.
Strikemaster ice: Rule number one--
there are no rules.
Mc cobra: Yaah!
"Dude, you're seriously wack!"
Strikemaster ice: Word.
"Drago, on intercom: Ice!"
Strikemaster ice: Yo. Drago: Playtime's over.
The storm's almost here.
Finish securing the lightning rod.
"Mc cobra: You got it, dawg."
"I mean, sir, dawg. Dawg sir!"
"Drago: Once I absorb the storm's lightning,"
I'll be able to wipe out entire cities.
No one will dare oppose me!
(Alarm beeping)
Drago: Except for those chans!
I'll make the adjustments up on the roof.
You three can deal with our party crashers.
(Sniffs)
Jade: I gotta warn uncle Jackie.
"Jade, on p.A.: Uncle Jackie! Come here, uncle Jackie!"
"Jackie: Jade, where are you?"
"Jade: Uncle Jackie, if you can hear me,"
it's a trap! Ice and his crew are--aah!
Jackie: Jade? Jade?!
"Strikemaster ice: Yeah, nothing like a roaring fire"
to warm up a rainy day.
"Strikemaster ice: Give it up, runt."
No way you gettin' outta this room alive.
(Music blaring)
Strikemaster ice: Aah! Aah! Uhh!
"Jade: What, no earplugs?"
Uncle: Aiyaah-ah-ah-ah!
(Dizzy) Uncle doesn't feel so good.
Tohru: <i> Sensei!</i> Àjackie: Uncle!
Uncle: Can't uncle have one moment to clear head?
Mc cobra: Uhh!
Ohh!
Uncle: Must uncle do everything?
Mc cobra: Uhh!
"Jade: Uncle Jackie, drago's up on the roof"
tryin' to get supercharged by the storm.
Jackie: Uncle and I will stop drago.
"Tohru, take Jade outside to safety."
"Tohru: Uh, but it's raining out there."
Jade: Ohh.
(Elevator music playing)
(Elevator chimes)
Drago: No visitors.
Jackie: Whoa! Uncle: Aah!
Jackie: I suspect drago knows we are here.
"Tohru: Uhh! Jade, this is not helpful."
Huh?
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, peewee."
You and me got some unfinished bidness.
"Tohru: Jade, run!"
"Jade: I got your back, t.!"
Tohru: No! The other way!
Whoa!
"Strikemaster ice: Looks like it's just you and me, homes."
<i>Mano a</i> sumo.
Uncle: This is why uncle's shop on ground floor.
Tohru: Uhh!
Strikemaster ice: Ha ha ha!
"Ah, snap! Game over."
"Jade: Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?"
Think you got game?
Bring it on.
Tohru: Whoa!
Strikemaster ice: Waah!
Jackie and uncle: Bad day! Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!
"Jackie: We're pulling your plug, drago."
Uncle: <i> Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
<i>Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
<i>Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
Drago: Too late! The storm has arrived!
Uncle: Jackie!
Jackie: I know! We need a distraction.
Strikemaster ice: Not bad for a short stack.
"But today, first is best, and second is dead last."
"Jade: Think I'm ready for that rematch now, drew."
(Gasping)
"Jade: Aw, the ice man's all wet."
We'd better get you dried off
before you catch something nasty.
(Whooshing)
Jackie: Bwaaah! (Gulps)
Uncle: <i> Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
Drago: Uhh!
Uncle: <i> Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
<i>Yumo guay guai</i> à <i> fie Dee tseio!</i>
Drago: No! Not now!
Aah!
Jade: Ohh!
don't tell me we missed all the fireworks?
Drago: You can't defeat me!
I'm on top of the world!
"Jackie: Jade, I have reconsidered."
If you promise to play
"only after your homework is completed,"
you may have the robomercs game.
"Jade: No, thanks, uncle Jackie."
Been there. Done that.
"Jackie: Well, I am very proud of you."
"Tohru: Jade, I do not believe this will fit"
in the overhead compartment.
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, do you like riding roller coasters?"
Jackie: I do like these kind of exciting games.
"Roller coaster, airplane, everything high, fast."
"It makes my blood go fast, then I like it."
I don't know why I like these kind of things.
Tohru: Unh! Oh!
"Jade: That's it, big guy. Only 2 more miles."
"Tohru: Oh, I can't-- I can't make it."
Jade: Can't isn't in our vocabulary.
Feel the burn!
(Tohru groans)
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Jackie!
"Jade: What is it, uncle?"
Uncle: A drum!
"The immortal relic used to defeat po Kong,"
the mountain demon.
Demon chi has been activated!
Jackie: Canada.
Stone walls. Must be Quebec.
It's a walled city.
We'd better move quickly.
"After losing the thunder demon chi,"
drago will be more determined than ever.
(Tohru breathing heavily)
Jade: Going somewhere?
Jackie: Canada. The mountain demon chi is in Quebec.
Jade: Cool! I can practice my French.
"Croissant, crepe, creme brulee, baguette."
Tohru: Mmm! Baguette.
"Jade: No baguette, tohru!"
Think lean and mean protein.
"No bread, no pasta, no rice, no cookies, no cake."
Jackie: No Quebec.
And no argument.
You have a big math test tomorrow. Remember?
You stay here with tohru.
Jade: Aww. Tohru: Ugh!
(Chi-o-matic sputtering)
Jackie: Is it broken?
Uncle: Not anymore.
"Jackie: ""Ancient rice and artifacts collection?"""
Rice? I thought we were searching for a drum.
Maybe that thing <i> is</i> broken.
Maybe it's that new containment jar.
Uncle: Since when are you the big-time expert?
New containment jar not a problem.
Uncle made so device can hold
more than one demon chi at once.
Does not affect the way detector works.
Now knock.
French woman: <i> Bonjour.</i>
<i>Comment allez-vous</i> à <i> aujourd'hui?</i>
Jackie: Maybe we should have brought Jade.
Jackie: Uh... <i> Bonjour.</i>
"My name is Jackie chan,"
and this is my uncle.
"We are from America,"
and we are looking for an ancient drum.
Do you have one?
French woman: <i>Bienvenue.</i>
"<i>Entree, entree.</i>"
<i>Merci de venir.</i>
<i>Amusez-vous.</i>
Uncle: Uncle knows that people collect many things...
But rice?
Chopsticks?
Jackie: Wooden chopsticks.
"Uncle: Carved from ancient drumsticks, used to play"
immortal drum.
Jackie: But which ones?
"Drago: Chan fried rice, anyone?"
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Jackie: Drago!
"Drago: I'd say it was good to see you, chan,"
"but why start the day with a big, fat lie?"
Jackie: Uncle!
The chopsticks!
We will have to take them all!
French woman: <i> Qu'est-ce</i> à <i> que c'est?</i>
Jackie: Watch out!
"Uh, you know, I never did get your name."
Uncle: Aiiyaaa!
Drago: So how would you like your uncle to be cooked?
"Rare, medium or well-done!"
Jackie: Strike.
Uncle: Maybe uncle should retire?
"Drago: Dead end, old man,"
in more ways than one.
(Tohru grunting)
"Jade: Come on, tohru."
You need to get in shape.
"No pain, no gain."
Almost there.
(Tohru grunts)
Jade: Perfect! That was one.
"Way to push yourself, dude."
"Eating right is cool, you dig?"
"If you don't, your butt's too big."
"Sorry, pal."
Think lean. But cheer up!
There's a tasty tofu Patty back home with your name on it.
(Tohru groans)
Jackie: I don't think I've ever been so tired.
(Yawns)
Uncle: No yawning!
We have work to do!
(Yawns)
"Jackie: I know, I know."
We must find which chopsticks
contain the mountain demon chi.
(Uncle yawns)
(Grunts)
Jackie: You falling asleep!
Uncle: Stop pointing finger!
You are the one falling asleep!
"Jackie: No, I am wide awake!"
"But you, you are doing this!"
(Imitates yawn)
Uncle: Not sleeping.
Resting eyes.
But maybe tea will help you keep yours open.
Uncle will put kettle on...
In just a minute.
(Both snoring)
(Stomach growls)
(Stomach growls)
Tohru: I heard you the first time.
(Both snoring)
"Tohru: Ohh, I hate fish..."
And tofu Patty.
Mmm. Yummy pork fried rice.
No. Jade said I should not have rice.
One bite couldn't hurt.
Jade.
Hmm.
Pretty.
(Drago growls)
Drago: I can't believe we're back in this lame junkyard!
"The space needle lair, gone!"
"The thunder demon chi, gone!"
And any faith I ever had that you 3 were
"strong enough to beat Jackie chan, gone!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, dude,"
step off the blame game.
It wasn't our fault.
Drago: Then whose fault was it?!
Mc cobra: Yours?
Drago: You wanna guess again?
Mc cobra: Nah. I'm cool.
Drago: I'm through losing everything to Jackie chan.
I want that mountain demon chi.
And then it's payback time.
"Oh, yeah, it's gonna be something chan's never gonna forget."
Hear what I'm sayin'?!
But first thing's first.
"Strikemaster ice: Uh, are we supposed to follow him or what?"
Both: Huh?
Jade: 5 pounds?!
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Jackie: Mommy!
Jade: How did you gain 5 pounds in 2 days?
"You've been cheating on your diet, haven't you?"
Haven't you?!
You know what that means.
"Tohru: No! No, please. Not push-ups."
Jade: Drop and give me 20!
Tohru: That scale's an antique.
Perhaps it is defective.
Uncle: Nothing in uncle's shop is defective!
(Chi-o-matic sputters)
Jackie: Make that <i>almost</i> nothing.
"Uncle: Detector not defective,"
just temperamental.
Now hurry and dig through the chopsticks.
We are behind schedule because you fell asleep.
Jackie: So did you.
Uncle: Uncle merely resting brain.
Jackie: How is it possible?
None of these chopsticks contain the demon chi?
Uncle: Maybe you dropped pair?
Jackie: I did not drop anything.
Besides you were the one holding the bag.
Just admit it. I'm right.
That machine of yours has gone haywire.
Uncle: Uncle not saying yes. Uncle not saying no.
Uncle not saying haywire.
Uncle will run test.
Happy?
Jade: You've got to be kidding me!
7 more pounds in one day?
"don't even try to tell me you're not cheating,"
'cause I know you are!
Tohru: I may have been... Snacking.
"Jade: On what, concrete?"
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Uncle's been robbed!
"Jackie: What did they take? Ancient carvings, rare paintings?"
Uncle: Bagels!
Jackie: Bagels? Jade: Bagels.
"Uncle: Doughnuts, soup, hummus, everything's gone!"
Jackie: What kind of thief steals only food?
Uncle: Hungry thief.
Calling police.
Put out apb for uncle's cream cheese.
"Jackie: Uncle, the police don't have time"
to track down your--
Jade: Besides there <i>is</i> no thief.
It was just tohru...
Cheating on his diet.
He's gained 7 pounds since yesterday!
Tohru: Maybe I'm retaining a little water.
"Jade: Yeah, maybe you're retaining the pacific ocean."
Drago: <i> This</i> is more like it!
The right crib - makes all the difference.
"Strikemaster ice: Place rocks, d-man!"
"Mc cobra: Yeah, and these night vision things"
are off the hook!
"Drago: If you think this is sweet,"
just wait'll we bring it to the chans!
Strikemaster ice: Bring on the hurt...
Mc cobra: Bring on the pain!
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, so what's the plan, d-dude?"
Drago: Surprise attack on the antique shop
owned by chan's uncle.
Strikemaster ice: Cool. Hit 'em on their own turf.
"Drago: We're gonna take down the chans,"
"take down section 13,"
and then all the demon chi will finally be mine!
It's gonna be my turn to call the shots!
"Strikemaster ice: For reals, homes."
"Security guard: Hey, who's in there?"
Drago: We don't need any unnecessary heat right now.
Meeting adjourned.
don't forget the swag.
"Jackie: Uncle, it's very late."
Are you all right?
Uncle: Uncle is fine.
And so is chi detector.
Chopsticks do not have mountain demon chi.
Jackie: Then where did it go?
Jade: I knew it.
He is so weak.
Whoa! So not nutritious.
Tohru: Food!
Jade: Aah! Aah! Jackie! Uncle!
Uncle: Why can't niece use indoor voice?
Jade: Told ya. It's like he's a giant trash compactor.
(Jackie gasps)
Uncle: Not trash! Priceless antiques!
Drago: Approaching target of opportunity.
200 yards and closing.
Continue stealth mode.
Mc cobra: Why is he talkin' into the headset?
"Yo, we're right here."
Strikemaster ice: Dude's into protocol.
Drago: The chans will never see this coming.
Or anything else ever again.
Take no prisoners.
"Jackie: I don't know how it happened,"
but tohru must have absorbed the mountain demon chi.
Jade: Ya think?
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Han dynasty noodle cabinet!
"Tohru, uncle's shop is not an all you can eat buffet!"
No! Stop! - Not Tibetan prayer table!
Cost uncle small fortune!
Jackie: Uncle! Forget about the table!
We need to remove - the demon chi from tohru.
Uncle: How about plastic mahjong set?
Much better for digestion!
Jade: Whoa. Looks like tohru's done with the appetizers.
Jackie: And moving on to the main course.
Uncle: Uncle's afraid today's special is San Francisco!
Jade: Hurry! We must remove the mountain demon chi from tohru
before he turns the entire city into breakfast!
All: Whaa! Hyah!
"Drago: Game over, chan!"
Strikemaster ice: Whoa! Looks like somebody already crizzashed this partay!
Mc cobra: Drag.
Drago: Grrr!
I smell demon chi.
"Jackie: Tohru, stop!"
Jade: Whoa! He is so gonna have heartburn.
Uncle: Too far away. Must get closer!
Jackie: Aah!
"Oh, no! Not now!"
Ow!
"Bad day, bad day."
Jade!
Uncle: Aiiyaa!
Jade: Aah! Aah!
Tohru: Jade.
Jade: Aah!
"Drago: It's over, chan!"
Your family tree is about to be chopped down!
Strikemaster ice: Whoa! Earthquake?
Jade: Tohru quake!
(Tohru grunting)
Tohru: Arrgh! (Snorts)
All: Aah!
"Drago: Yo, jolly green freak show!"
"You've got something that belongs to me,"
and I want it back!
(All grunting)
Uncle: Jackie! The blowfish!
Jackie: Whoa!
"Jade, stay here."
"Jade: This time, I think I will."
(Uncle chanting in Chinese)
Jackie: Uncle!
Wait!
"If you remove the mountain demon chi from tohru,"
he will be crushed!
Jackie: No! Tohru!
Tohru: Ugh!
Drago: Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
(Uncle chanting in Chinese)
Drago: No!
Drago: You're gonna pay for that!
Uncle: Uncle doesn't have cash.
How about I.O.U.?
(Chanting in Chinese)
Drago: Aah!
(Uncle chanting)
Tohru: Ugh! What's happening?
Jackie: Uncle is trying to remove drago's fire power.
Jade: Yes!
(Uncle chanting)
Drago: Aghh!
Ugh!
My fire power!
This isn't over!
Jackie: Actually... I think it is.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, don't sweat it, d-man."
We got your back!
Jade: Ooh! Uncle really put drago's fire breath on ice!
Jackie: And now - section 13 will finally have
all the demon chi powers under control.
(Tohru burping)
"Tohru: Ooh, sorry."
Must've been something I ate.
"Jade: Yeah, well, I hope you enjoyed your little binge,"
"'cause from here on out, I have 2 words for you."
Celery sticks.
And don't think that just because you saved us and everything
"you get to skip your workout tomorrow, 'cause that's not gonna happen."
Tohru: Unhh!
"Jade: Hey, Jackie, have you ever flown a plane?"
"Jackie: Actually, I did."
"Not the commercial one, of course, the private jet,"
with the pilot and the copilot let me to drive.
But I'd really like to learn helicopter.
"Ah. No dragons, no demons, no worries."
"I hear ya, t."
Complete dullsville. Worst vacation ever.
"Jade, uncle and I are going snorkeling."
Guess I'll go too.
Maybe I can find some sunken treasure or something.
"Um, why don't you stay on shore with tohru?"
My feet could use coat of sunblock.
"No offense, but I'd rather kiss a sand crab."
Check it out! Kung fu frisbee! Hee-yaa!
-Huh? -(Chuckles) Little help?
(Groaning)
(Grunting)
Jade?
(Groaning)
(Gasps)
(Screams)
Jade! You weren't supposed to...
"Oh, why do I bother?"
I knew this wasn't really a vacation.
"So, what's the 411 on the big blue marble?"
No marble.
One half of the arcanum of chi created by ancient wizard madjo.
"When reunited with its other half,"
"it becomes a powerful relic, increasing any chi spell, ten-fold."
(Grunts) Got it!
-(Rumbling) -(Gasps)
(Roaring)
-Bad day! -Bad day!
Bad day!
(Roaring)
Ancient chi master must have cast protection spell.
-What was your first clue? -(Both screaming)
Uncle! I'm short-handed!
(Both screaming)
(Chanting)
Uh-oh. Blowfish waterlogged.
(Roaring)
Jade! Uncle!
(Exclaims)
(Grunts)
(Roars)
(Both gasp)
(Panting)
"-Uncle Jackie! -(Coughing) Jade, wait!"
(Screams)
(Roaring)
(Gasps)
Now this is a vacation.
"Uh, okay if I sit here?"
An alternative location for your posterior is advisable.
(Laughing)
Jade: I think this belongs to you.
"-Thanks, Jade. -Tough day?"
More like every day.
I don't fit in with anyone.
I'm such a freakoid.
"If you wanna meet some real freakoids,"
"Uncle: Orb half was hidden in watery, cold location"
representing yin chi.
"Other half must be in earthy, hot location, representing Yang."
Location spell will reveal exact whereabouts.
"Tohru, begin!"
Jackie's the world's most kick-butt archeologist.
"Uncle's a chi wizard and the big guy's tohru, uncle's apprentice."
My research suggests the final ingredient is essence of ginseng.
(Groans)
(Sneezes)
(Groans) I will never be a chi wizard.
"A chi wizard must learn from defeats as well as victories, tohru."
(Sneezes)
"Aw, gross!"
"Hi, unc. Got a tissue?"
Aiya! Jade knows uncle does not like being spied on!
I was just giving my friend Jimmy the vip tour.
Sorry. The smoke made me...
(Sneezes)
(All gasp)
-Got it! -(Uncle exclaims)
"Arcanum, ancient magical relic, not pop fly!"
"Come, uncle."
We will take the orb to section 13 for safe keeping.
"It was nice to meet you, Jimmy, and good catch."
Is uncle always that cranky?
No. He is in a particularly good mood today.
-(Hissing) -Huh?
(Rapid footsteps)
(Gasps)
"Unless uncle Jackie went spandex,"
looks like section 13's got a thief.
Whoa! Whoa! A chi blast?
(Chanting)
(Gasp) Time portal!
(Screaming)
(Grunting)
Whoa. New and improved.
We gotta be talkin' the future here.
(Grunts)
(Both gasp)
-Jade? -What are you doing here?
"This is my time, duh! What's your story?"
Some guy snagged the arcanum of chi.
"I chased him through a time portal and, babamo, here I am."
Iso!
(Beeping)
-No sign of him now... -Time out. Who's iso?
Only <i> numero uno</i> on section 13's most wanted list.
So why are we standing here?
Let's go track down the bad guy.
Two jades are better than one.
"Love to, but no can do."
No can what?
Captain black's put me on desk duty
"for ""unauthorized use of a magical item,"
"""resulting in destruction of public property."""
(Scoffs) Like he never blew up a donut shop with a dragon talisman before.
Hmm. No prob.
I'll do some solo re-con until you can come out to play.
"So, where does iso hang?"
Intel suggests his lair is somewhere in the pavilion mall area...
"Wait, what am I saying?"
"If captain black finds you here, I'll wind up a section 13 janitor."
We have to send you back to your own time.
"Jade, we brought your favorite,"
triple black bean burritos.
Thanks.
Time hoppin' gives me the major munchies.
All: Jade?
Aiya! Young Jade and older Jade?
Uncle has deja vu all over again.
"Jade, explain."
Both: Iso stole our half of the arcanum of chi in the past
by using a time portal spell.
So I followed him through when he escaped back to the future!
"No... please, one Jade at a time."
"Aiya! Why would iso go to so much trouble, unless..."
Unless he has discovered the location of the other half of the arcanum.
Jimmy: Sensei?
-Jimmy? -Jade?
"Uh, how come there's a..."
Which one is the...
Both: Time portal spell.
But what are you doing here?
"I'm tohru's apprentice, he's a full chi wizard now."
"Way to go, big t! And you too, Jimmy."
I owe it all to you for introducing us.
Captain black: Agent chan!
Hide! Now!
"Gentlemen. Jade, I need you asap."
"Yes, sir. I'm aware of iso's recent break-in and..."
Iso? Here? Nothing unusual popped on the security grid.
I'll organize a team to make a sweep immediately.
Almost forgot. Copy and collate these.
"Yes, sir."
Jade... Jade? Where did she go?
Shopping for a bad guy.
"<i>Hello. May I interest you</i> <i>in a beautiful</i> <i>handmade mirror, today?</i>"
"-No, thank you. -(Whirring)"
Look out!
A hologram hard sell. Freaky!
"Whoa! Jade, check it out."
The mirror lady's totally virtual.
"Come on, Jade, it's go time, as in you have to go back to your own time."
-What about finding iso? -Not our problem.
What happened to you? You used to rock!
Think I like pushing papers all day?
"I don't, but this is my job and captain black is my boss."
"You have to grow up sometime, Jade."
Speak for yourself!
(Beeps)
-Uh-oh. What's happening? -(Alarm blaring)
I'm not sure.
(Both screaming)
(Loud thud)
(Door opens)
Both: Phew!
"Spell books, potions, major funky mojo."
-This has to be... -Both: Iso's lair!
(Blowing)
-The arcanum! -(Both gasp)
Both: Whoa!
(Grunts)
Iso: This must be my lucky day.
"What a bargain, two jades for the price of one."
(Screams)
Hee-yaa!
(Groans)
(Grunts) Timber!
(Groans)
Both: Nice work.
-Maybe we lost him. -(Explosion)
(People screaming)
Maybe not.
Hop on.
(Chanting)
Dark chi coming up fast.
(Screaming)
(Roaring)
(Gasps)
-We can't out run it. -I have an idea. Follow me!
(Roaring)
I sure hope you know what we're doing 'cause I don't!
Climb!
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
Emergency exit!
I am very proud of you both.
The time portal spell is ready.
So it's save the day and don't let the door hit you on the way out?
-Harsh. -Captain black: Jade!
(Grunts)
I suppose congratulations are in order.
"-Well, it was nothing really. -You're too modest."
Who else could destroy an entire shopping mall in a single afternoon?
"Captain black, believe me, I know Jade does not always follow the rules, but..."
"I'm sorry, Jackie."
"Jade, you're like family, but enough is enough."
"Turn in your badge, you're fired."
-You can't do that! -Jade?
"(Stuttering) - I'm sending you both home, immediately."
(Sighs)
"Jade, wait! Whoa!"
"-Jimmy, what are you... -Jade, just listen."
I figured out a spell to locate the other half of the orb.
(Chanting)
"Whoa! That's eagle's peak,"
a dormant volcano just outside the city!
"Jimmy, you're a genius!"
You up for a little rock climbing?
Me? I'm not a field agent.
"But if I were,"
and I needed to do something major to win back my job...
I knew there was a reason we became friends.
"Jade, we have to talk."
Shouldn't you be hurtling back through the time continuum about now?
"Doesn't matter, if you'll excuse me, I have to pack up my stuff."
"Okay, be all mopey,"
but I know where to find the other half of the arcanum.
-Whoa! -I'm listening.
(Grunting)
"Hello, beautiful."
(Screeching)
That madjo wizard - must have cast a protection spell over this half too!
Duh!
(Grunts) Whoa! That pigeon needs a manicure.
We are so outta here!
-Repel! -(Both screaming)
Between those boulders!
(Screeching)
I like the way you think.
Of course! The other half of arcanum was atop volcanic mountain!
"Yang location, earthy and hot!"
"Well done, uncle."
Uncle was not responsible. Tohru?
-Actually it was... -Jimmy: Me.
"It took me over 10 years of research,"
but now I'm going to reap the rewards.
"""Reap the rewards?"""
"Jimmy, what are you talking about?"
"Actually, call me... Iso!"
(All gasp)
(Grunting)
(Chanting)
"Aiya! Tohru, your apprentice has been seduced by dark chi!"
"Oh, this is all my fault!"
"No, I owe it all to Jade. She introduced us."
Both: Our bad.
"Since I never fit in with any cliques, it's time to create my own!"
(Chanting)
Whoa.
Go low!
(Grunting)
(Grunting)
(Screaming)
(Grunts)
Uncle! Do something!
The arcanum is too powerful.
Must first find Jimmy's weakness.
don't ever call me Jimmy again.
Aiya!
Both: You thinking what I'm thinking?
"T, the time portal spell! Need it!"
(Grunting)
-Now? -No time like the present!
Secure all exits!
"don't worry, captain black. I'm not going anywhere."
"Once I level this dump, no one will able to stop me."
(Chanting)
(Growling)
(Grunting)
He has an endless army of isos.
-How do we stop him? -Magic must defeat magic.
Hold the line.
"Uh, excuse us, big t, gotta talk to Jimmy, it's kinda personal."
Tell me what scares you the most.
"Aw, I knew it! You're just like all the rest."
"Well, if you think I'm gonna tell you how to torture me, forget it."
"-Seriously, we haven't got time for this. -Hey."
(Grunts)
Welcome to the future. Come on.
(Grunting)
That's me.
"-Do I rock, or what? -What about me?"
You're more like disco.
(Grunting)
(Chanting)
I'm the bad guy?
"Way bad, but you don't have to be."
Heights. I'm afraid of heights.
Right. That's why you didn't get your backpack out of that tree.
Or climb eagle's peak to grab the other half of the orb.
Iso tricked us into doing his dirty work for him!
(Grunting)
Talismans! Get your talismans!
(Meowing)
(Chanting)
(Grunting)
Hee-yaa!
(Screaming)
(All gasp)
Got it!
Huh?
Iso: (Shuddering) Put me down!
If you insist.
(Screaming)
"I may be a freakoid now,"
but there's no way I'm turning into a mega-loser like you.
"Jade, I'm a big enough man to admit when I am wrong."
Your old job's waiting for you at section 13.
"Yes, sir!"
"We won't let you down, cb. I mean, she won't."
I know you won't.
"This is such a relief, the filing was really beginning to pile up."
"Even with iso in custody,"
"I believe it will be safer to destroy the arcanum back in your time, Jade."
Thanks for the reboot.
Guess I just needed a little kick in the butt to start kicking butt again.
"No prob. Hey, maybe I'll come back and visit sometime."
All: No!
Aiya! Half orb missing!
"Two halves are better than one, I always say."
"Jade, explain."
"<i>Hey, Jackie, do you ever wish</i> <i>you could see into the future?</i>"
"Oh, yes. I really hope I can have this kind of power."
I can see the future.
I can predict what happens.
"Then, I guess, I believe I can save a lot of people."
"Waitress: Refill, hon?"
Black: Thanks.
(Sighs)
Nice to have a few minutes
before heading into the office.
Waitress: So what do you do?
"Black: Oh, uh..."
I'm in pest control.
"Waitress: Ha. Got a few in this place, I can tell you that."
(Engine revving)
Black: Hey! What the--uhh!
"Waitress: What, no tip?"
(Crash)
Uncle: Eyaah!
"You break it, you bought it!"
(Gasps)
Uncle: Eyaah!
Uncle reserves right to refuse service to <i> you.</i>
S-whoooooo!
Zwwww! Uhh!
I broke it...
You still bought it! Oop!
(Tohru whistling)
(Gasps)
Jackie: No! Stop!
The persian carpet should go to the left of the abyssinian.
(Cell phone rings)
"Oh, excuse me."
Hello?
"Tohru: Jackie, something has happened to uncle."
He has been taken away in a huge vehicle.
"Jackie, yelling: I am sorry, tohru."
It is hard to hear you.
There is a very loud truck outside.
Jackie: Bwaaaa!
"Uh, deliveries in the back, please."
"Strikemaster ice: Not a delivery, yo..."
It's a pick up...
And you're the merchandise.
Ugh! That's all right.
We'll just kick it old school.
Jackie: Uhh!
"Please, no more kicking it..."
"Or punching it,"
and especially no burning it.
"Whatever is troubling you,"
why don't we discuss it outside?
These carpets are a thousand years old.
Strikemaster ice: For reals? Tsk.
"Now see, a museum this nice"
ought to spring for a new wall-to-wall shag.
Jackie: Aah!
"Jackie: Aah! Kettle... Hot, hot, hot!"
"Strikemaster ice: Aw, dawg,"
you just need to put a little ice on that...
Strikemaster ice.
Jackie: Uhh!
(Jackie groans)
Ms. hardman: And this is another perfect example
of prehistoric man.
Now let's move on to a later specimen:
The brutish cro-magnon man.
Kids: Ugh! Yikes! What the...
Jade: Tohru?? What's going--uhh!
"Tohru: Uh, may Jade be excused?"
"Ms. hardman: Uh... Well, I--I suppose."
Has she been signed out at the office?
Jade: Jackie <i> and</i> uncle?
Tohru: Yes. I phoned section 13
and it seems captain black is missing as well.
"Jade: This is big, t."
Tohru: What's most important is that I keep you safe.
"Jade: Safe, nothing. Time to tcb."
Take care of business.
Hello?
"Rescue Jackie, uncle, and the captain."
Jade: Ok. Job one:
Search for clues.
Once we I.D. The perps--
(phone rings)
Tohru: It is Jackie's cell phone calling.
Jade: Jackie?
Drago: Unnhhh! Guess again.
"But your uncle is a guest of mine,"
"along with the old-timer and captain ""whack."""
Jade: You touch one hair on their heads--
"well, not captain black,"
"'cause, you know, he doesn't have any,"
but you know what I mean!
"Drago: Uh, you're in no position to be making threats, junior,"
but their safe return is up to you.
Jade: So it's a ransom you're after.
I'm listening.
Drago: Here's the deal.
You get all 3 of them back
when I get - the containment unit.
"You know, the one with all the demon chi."
"Jade: Yeah, well..."
I don't know what you're talking about.
(Sniffs)
"You had garlic for breakfast, didn't you?"
Drago: don't play dumb.
Deliver the chi or else.
Jade: It'll take some time.
"Drago: Time is something you don't have, pipsqueak."
We make the switch at 3 A.M. on the golden gate bridge.
Be there or--
Jade: Be square?
Drago: No! Be there or you'll be spending
the rest of your wonder years
being raised by that 500-pound sumo.
Jade: Sheesh! Evil <i> and</i> a jerk.
Tohru: Hmmph! I weigh only 480.
Jade: Ok. We gotta go along with what drago says.
Jackie and uncle and black's lives are at stake.
Tohru: But allowing drago to take possession of the demon powers
will put the entire planet at risk.
Jade: Duh! That's why we're gonna pull a fast one.
"Sure, we deliver the containment unit,"
but not before - you come up with a spell.
Tohru: A spell? Jade: Yep.
A spell to put the kibosh on drago--
to short-circuit the powers as soon as drago sucks 'em up.
Tohru: That's a wonderful ID--
wait. I am just uncle's apprentice.
A spell that powerful is...
"Well, beyond my abilities."
"Jade: What are you talking about, big guy?"
You've got mad skills! You know what uncle told me?
"He said, (Imitating uncle) ""Tohru may be most naturally gifted wizard"
"uncle has ever met."""
Tohru: Really?
"Jade: Uh, well, maybe not those exact words,"
but with the same accent.
"The point is, he totally believes in you, and so do I."
Jade: Where are you going?
Tohru: I have a spell to conjure.
"Jade: You go, t! I know you can do it!"
"She said, hopefully."
Drago: Everyone comfy?
No? Good.
"Black: Whatever it is you want, drago,"
(chains clatter) You're not going to get it.
"Drago: Oh, but I am!"
In 8 chi-licious flavors.
Jackie: The containment unit.
Drago: I first considered an assault on section 13
but then realized... Why battle for it
"when the containment unit can be hand-delivered in a nice, tidy bow."
Uncle: Huh! Too much time in junkyard makes demon speak rubbish!
"Drago: Think again, old-timer."
You know the old saying...
A chan is only as strong as its weakest link.
Tch. I hope it's not a school night.
Jackie: Leave Jade out of this.
Drago: Too late! She's the main attraction.
And showtime's 3 A.M.!
But wait--there's more!
"Once the demon chi is mine,"
the real fun begins!
Jackie: A trip to mooseworld is fun.
What you have in mind is... Probably not fun!
Uh...Whatever it is.
"Drago: Oh, don't be such a party pooper, chan."
"See, this world of yours is a real yawn,"
and you know why? No demons.
They're all stuck down under
while you humans run around like you own the place!
Is that fair? No!
"Well, guess what! Planet's about to come under new management!"
And my first order of business will be
to turn this world inside out!
Just imagine... A population of demons running amok
"with me, drago, pulling the strings!"
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!
"Yeah, pretty soon now it's good-bye, humanity,"
"hello, demonville!"
Daddy would be so proud.
"Come on, gang, gimme some props."
Uncle: Bah! Dopey demon will not succeed.
"Drago: Oh? And why's that, grandpa?"
Jackie: Because we are going to
stop yo-ou-ou-ou!
Drago: Catch!
Jackie: Uncle!
Black: Jackie.
I think those chains need a lube job.
Jackie: Ha! The oily bird always catches the worm.
"Drago: Yeah? Well, today's oily bird special"
is some free body work!
(Metal crashes)
Strikemaster ice: Goin' somewhere?
"Jackie, tiny voice: Bad day."
Mc cobra: Ha ha. - Hope you like your new digs!
Drago: I told you to stay nearby.
They nearly escaped!
"Strikemaster ice: Yeah, dawg, we noticed. Too much for ya, huh?"
Drago: I wouldn't take that tone with me if I were you.
Oh!
"Strikemaster ice: You ain't the big cheese no more, d."
Me and my posse got <i> mad</i> powers!
You got zip.
"Drago: Yes, well, that's about to change."
"And when it does, I won't forget our little chat."
Tohru: It is ready!
"Jade: The spell? Tohru: Uh, no. My tea."
It helps me to concentrate.
I am still working on the spell.
"Jade: No pressure, big guy, but clock's ticking."
Ready?
Tohru: No. Soon.
Jade: We good to go?
Tohru: Not yet.
Jade: Ready?
Tohru: Yes! Jade: Yes!
Tohru: And...No.
Jade: Translation?
"Tohru: I believe the spell could work,"
but we are missing a key ingredient.
Jade: Name it! I'll make a run to the 24/7 store.
"Tohru: It requires an essence of drago,"
something physical such as a piece of hair
or a fingernail.
Jade: You mean like a DNA sample?
Tohru: Yes. I have failed.
Jade: Hold up. In school we learned that relatives share DNA.
"So something from a member of drago's family could work, too!"
Tohru: Perhaps. But what good--
shendu!
"Jade: Dear old dad, in lockup in section 13,"
right next door to the containment unit.
Tohru: He is encased in stone.
"Jade: Yeah, well, then guess we'll have to take a chip off the old block."
Let's move!
(Shendu rasping)
Jade: Aah!
Jade: You're not scaring me.
You're stuck in stone and can't do a thing!
Shendu: Why so nervous?
"As you say, I am powerless in my current form."
Yet see how the very elements of your earthly realm
shatter in my presence!
Jade: Yeah. Ok. Whatever.
Great special effects...Not!
Shendu: I know why you are here.
Jade: No way.
"Shendu: My ungrateful traitor of a son, drago!"
He is close to gaining possession of the demon powers.
"Jade: But it's not gonna happen, not on my watch!"
Shendu: Foolish child!
"There is but one power on earth that can defeat drago,"
"and it is I, his father."
"Jade: We're on the same page, rocky road."
Shendu: What do you think you're--
Jade: Just a trim. You'll never miss it.
Thanks. don't get up. I'll let myself out.
"Shendu, in fury: Aaahh!"
Tohru: It is nearly 3:00. Did you--
Jade: Piece of cake! Come on!
We have a date with a demon to get to!
(Tohru grunts)
Uncle: Eyaaah! It is almost 3:00!
"Do something, Jackie!"
"Jackie, grunting: Oh!"
"I am trying, uncle!"
(Grunts)
Ow!
Uncle: Trying not helping.
Doing would be helping.
Black: I'm sure Jade wouldn't be so foolish
as to actually deliver the containment unit to drago.
"Jackie: To protect us, I fear Jade might do anything."
Uncle: Only one opportunity to stop drago
if he obtains all demon powers.
"Uncle needs to have chi-o-matic,"
make a few adjustments.
(Growls from ice and crew)
"Black: Jackie, what if we break huddle, throw ourselves at the line,"
and allow uncle to make an end run?
Not a football fan. Got it.
Uncle: He means you should create diversion!
Jackie: Oh! Yes.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, these fools be getting all silly!"
Strikemaster ice: Dudes tried to bust a move. As if.
Drago: Where's the geezer?
Strikemaster ice: Oh. Ain't no thing.
Gotta be around here somewhere.
Drago: Idiot! Just wrap them up and get them in the truck.
"Strikemaster ice: - What's the magic word, dawg?"
"Jade: Ok, t, you hang in the shadows."
"Soon as drago shows, you blast him with that voodoo that you do."
Tohru: We must time it precisely.
The spell may only be activated
at the exact moment drago begins to absorb the chi.
Jade: Roger that.
The demon has landed.
Drago: Show me the chi!
Jade: Show me the chan clan!
Drago: I told you slackers to stay in the truck.
"Strikemaster ice: Yeah, well us slackers"
kinda changed our minds about how it's gonna go down.
Drago: Oh?
Mc cobra: Figured why let <i> you</i> get all the powers?
Drago: You... Want some of them?
"Strikemaster ice: No, dawg. We want <i> all</i> of them!"
"Drago: I may not have fire,"
but you're still toast!
"Tohru: Oh, this was not part of the plan!"
Jade: No kidding.
(Crew making attack cries)
(Drago grunts)
Tohru: This is not good. The spell!
Jade: I know. It'll only work if drago grabs the chi!
"Never thought I'd say this, but..."
"Come on, drago, you're the man!"
"If you can't do it, no one can!"
Jackie: The keys are still in the ignition.
Jade: Drago won! Yes!
"¶ Go, demon, he's a winner, oh, yeah-- ¶"
strikemaster ice: Too bad. Dude hates the water.
"Jade: Hey, no Jackie, no containment unit."
We had a deal.
"Mc cobra: Yeah? Well, my man dj fist's got the deal-breaker."
Jade: Look out! Tohru: No!
Oh...Uh...
"Strikemaster ice: 8 powers, 3 of us..."
"Let's see, we gotta divide that by 8 by 3--"
"uh, carry the-- naw, see we--wait. Naw."
Mc cobra: 2 of us gets 3. One of us gets 2.
"Strikemaster ice: Ok, here's the dilly-o."
"Dj, you get earth and moon."
"See, 'cause those are the 2 best powers, yo."
I'm doin' you a solid here.
(Fist growls)
Jade and tohru: Bad day.
Jackie: Can't see!
Mc cobra: Hoo hoo! Yeah! Feel the burn!
"Strikemaster ice: Look out, San Fran,"
"'cause we're gonna turn this sucker out, yo!"
"Jackie: No, you are not!"
"Black: Jackie, you can't take them on."
"No arms, no legs."
Jackie: No problem.
It is simply a matter of...
Balance.
Mc cobra: Ooh! Here comes the cavalry.
Lemme water their horses.
Tohru and Jade: Whoa!
(The crew laughs)
"Strikemaster ice: What are you gonna do, bite us?"
"Mc cobra: Let's school the fool. Check it out, yo!"
Thunder and lightning!
Jackie: Is that... The best you can do?
"Strikemaster ice: Naw. We just gettin' started, yo."
"Power of the wind, yo!"
(Jackie mumbling)
I am still standing.
Ow.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, let's finish this."
We got a whole world out there to cruise and bruise!
Yo. Somebody call a cab?
Uncle: <i> Yo mo guai guey</i> à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>
"Mc cobra: Hey, the geezer's got that chi-suckin' gizmo!"
Jade: Uncle! Yes!
"Tohru: Sensei must have adjusted the chi-o-matic,"
allowing it to absorb all the demon-chi at once!
Uncle: <i> Yo mo guai guey</i> à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>
<i>Yo mo guai guey</i> à <i> fi Dee tsao!</i>
Eyaaah! Something rotten in Denmark!
"Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
"<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
Jackie: Drago is drawing the powers to himself!
"How can he do that, uncle?"
Uncle: Do not know. Never heard that spell before.
"Yes, keep change!"
Jade: Whoa! Drago must have been taking night classes. Got a new spell.
New spell! Do yours--now!
"Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
Tohru: <i> Mee tahna...Chi!</i> À <i> chi-mee tahna...Chi!</i>
Oh!
Uncle: Eeaaah!
"Drago: Finally, all the demon powers-- mine!"
"Strikemaster ice: Uh, yo, we helped, d. don't forget that."
"Drago: Take a last look at this world of yours, humans!"
Because I'm about to turn it topsy-turvy
and all kinds of curvy!
But first things first...
"<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
"<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i> - à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
"<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
"Jade: Hey Jackie, what's the most embarassing thing that's ever happened to you?"
"Oh, I remember."
There was almost 20-some years ago.
"I was doing a difficult shot. I was doing the hacky-sack, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
So many takes.
And sweating.
"After the shot, I want to go in the cold water."
"I take off my shirt. I try to take off my pants,"
but my pants stick with my underwear.
Underwear is gone.
That's the most embarrassing.
Announcer: Previously on <i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>
"Drago: Your uncle <i>is</i> a guest of mine,"
you get all 3 of 'em back
when I get - the containment unit.
Show me the chi!
Jade: Show me the chan clan!
Drago: I told you slackers to stay in the truck.
"Strikemaster ice: Yeah, well us slackers"
kinda changed our minds about how it's gonna go down.
Jackie: Drago is drawing the powers to himself!
Drago: And my first order of business will be
to turn this world inside out!
(Jade and tohru grunt)
(Drago laughs)
Tohru: Oh...
"(Falling cries from uncle, tohru, Jade, and Jackie)"
"(Falling cries from uncle, tohru, Jade and Jackie)"
(Grunting)
Tohru: Puh! I hate fish.
"Drago: Prepare yourselves, my demon brethren."
Your liberation awaits.
"Mc cobra: So, uh, what do we do?"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, if d-boy be turnin' the earth inside-out,"
I'm stickin' with the man like wax on a board.
You feel me?
"Black: Ok, people, listen up!"
"At 0300 hours, drago absorbed all 8 demon chi powers."
I'll need all available equipment and personnel
ready to deploy by Dawn.
"This isn't going to be easy,"
but I know you're up to the task.
The fate of the entire planet rests in our hands.
"Now, let's move!"
(Agents talking excitedly)
"Uncle: All these years,"
black has learned nothing.
Magic must defeat magic.
Black: Drago was last seen heading east.
"Jade: Agent Jade reporting for duty, <i> sir!</i>"
Let's head 'em up and move 'em out.
"Black: Jade, I think you've done enough for one night."
Jade: I didn't mean for drago to keep the demon chi.
I had a plan to--
"Jackie: We know you were trying to protect us, Jade,"
and we appreciate it.
"Black: But from here on out, little lady,"
you need to leave the fight to the heavyweights.
Uncle: Drago has absorbed all 8 demon powers.
Do you know of a spell to remove them?
Shendu: And why should I help you?
Uncle: Revenge?
"Shendu: My son <i> may</i> have betrayed me, wizard,"
but I will watch proudly as he destroys your world.
"Once all 8 powers have combined,"
nothing can remove them... Ever.
Uncle: Then conversation is over.
Shendu: Wait!
Release me.
I will deal with drago and see that you are spared.
"Uncle: Ohh, that uncle cannot do."
Shendu: Then your earth is doomed.
"Black: No, Mr. mayor, this is not a drill."
We need to evacuate the entire city immediately.
Uh...Meteors--that's right--
"heading this way. Oh! Big ones,"
"size of, um..."
Big meteors.
Gotta go.
Tohru: Hmm. Is there also a plan to evacuate
the rest of the planet?
"Jade: I know I messed up,"
"but let me make it up to you, please, Jackie?"
You can't split up the chan clan at a time like this.
"Jackie: No, Jade."
"Section 13 is the safest place in the city,"
and you are staying right here.
Jade: Awww!
"Jackie: Tohru, I need you to take care of Jade."
Tohru: I understand.
"Strikemaster ice: Uh, it was a misunderstanding, yo?"
Drago: I don't suffer traitors well.
"Strikemaster ice, dj fist & mc cobra: Yizow! Wah! Yeeah!"
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, that is nasty."
(Uncle mumbles)
(Knock on door)
Uncle: Shop is closed!
(Knocking continues)
Go away!
Uncle is busy!
(Knocking)
Do you want drago - to turn world inside-out?
No? Then let uncle work!
One more thing...
Aiyaaa!
"Chow: Whoa, take it easy, old timer."
Hak foo: We are not here to harm you.
Finn: Yeah. We just heard about this whole
drago-turning-the- world-inside-out thing.
Ratso: I think there was meteors comin'.
"Chow: Hey, the world can't end now."
We just got out of the slammer.
It ain't fair.
"Finn: So whaddya say, unc?"
We're freelance. We're reasonably priced.
Ratso: And we promise not to steal nothin'.
Uncle: Do not just stand there. Get cracking!
Strikemaster ice: Yo! It's 5-0.
"Black: All right, you punks."
Where's drago?
Drago: Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Black: You have got to be kidding me.
Jackie: Bad day.
"Jade: We can't just sit here, tohru."
Jackie needs our help.
Tohru: Your safety - is Jackie's primary concern.
"Jade: Come on, big t. We're missing all the action."
Grrr.
Drago: I was hoping you'd put up a fight.
Black: It's go time.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, we can't let drago have all the fun."
"Sorry 'bout your ride, cueball."
Black: Oof!
Ah--uhh.
Mc cobra: Boo-yah!
"Jackie: You don't talk much, do you?"
Oof!
Drago: Mmm! Tasty.
(Burp)
(Agents yell)
"(Strength efforts from strikemaster ice, dj fist, & mc cobra)"
Black: Fall back!
All agents fall back!
Drago: Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
It's pointless to run!
There's nowhere on earth to hide from your new masters.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, we spank those fools."
(Drago growls)
Drago: I should prepare a proper welcome
for my demon brethren.
A city in ruins will - make them feel right at home.
Strikemaster ice: Cool! Let's get this party started.
Drago: No. I have a special task for you.
I have given you each another taste of demon chi:
Earth...
Thunder...Wind.
Strikemaster ice: Whoa. What's the dilly-yo?
Drago: I want you to eliminate section 13
and everyone in it
once and for all.
Drago: Bwa ha ha ha ha ha!
(Panicked screams from passengers)
"Jackie: Captain black, on the bridge!"
Black: I see it. Go! Go!
Clip your end to the bridge!
(Frightened shouts from passengers)
"Jade: Talismans, yes!"
"Drago's got chi power, but we have t-power."
"Tohru, we have to get them to Jackie."
Tohru: Jade--
Jade & tohru: Whoa-oh...
Strikemaster ice: Yo yo yo!
The ice crew is in the hiz-zouse.
"Jade: Bring it on, crater face."
Hyah!
"Tohru: Stay back, Jade."
Jade: Grrrr.
(Attack cry from tohru)
(Groan)
Strikemaster ice: Ooh...
That's gonna leave a mark.
Jade: The gecko gang got a booster shot.
Time to give 'em a taste of their own medicine...
Talisman style.
"Tohru: Jade, no!"
Whoa!
"Strikemaster ice: Aw, you're worried about the shorty."
"That's sweet, yo,"
"but you best be worried about yourself, big man."
Uncle: Scale of codfish!
Finn: Comin' right up. Whoa!
Uncle: Nail of groundhog.
"Chow: Yeah, I got it!"
Whoa!
Powdered butterfly wing!
Ratso: Monarch or swallowtail?
"Black, straining: Can't..."
Hang on much longer.
(Passengers fret)
(Rope whiplashes)
"El toro: I thought you could use a hand, <i> mi amigos.</i>"
Jackie: El toro!
"Viper: Heard you were having a shindig, Jackie."
"Jackie: Viper--eh, viper."
Paco: And do not forget El paco fuerte.
Where is Jade?
(Tug-of-war efforts from all)
(Driver sighs)
Woman: Thank you.
Valmont?
El toro: Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
El toro fuerte never removes his mask.
Black: Apparently drago's lookin' to play a little ball.
"Jackie: Well, he's going to have to beat the home team."
(Massive strength effort from tohru)
Jade! Jade!
"Jade, what are you doing?"
Jade: Nabbing the talisman so we can kick that ice twerp's butt.
Tohru: We must leave...Now!
Strikemaster ice: You ain't goin' nowhere.
Tohru: Whoa! Uhh!
Jade: Tohru!
Strikemaster ice: Peace out!
"Tohru: Jade, leave here!"
Jade: Rat? No. Tiger? No.
"Come on, ox, where are you?"
"Tohru: Uhh! Do as I say, Jade!"
Leave here! <i> Now!</i>
"Jade: Hang on, t!"
Monkey? Rabbit?
No! Tohru!
Tohru...
Uncle: Aiyaaa!
Spell will not work.
Chow: So...The earth is doomed?
Ratso: But I like it here. My mom lives close.
Uncle: We must get reinforcements.
(Drago chewing)
Viper: Ew. Chew with your mouth closed.
Drago: Chan!
You're just in time to watch me rip your planet <i> wide</i> open!
Paco: You'll have to get past the j-team first. Yulk!
"El toro: Stay in the dugout, paco."
"Paco: But I am ready, El toro."
I brought my own mask.
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, time to play ball!"
Uncle: Aiyaaa!
Section 13 is rubble.
"Finn: Eh, bummer."
"Chow: Eh, I never liked the place."
Ratso: They had good doughnuts.
Uncle: Stop!
"You want to earn paycheck, yes?"
Then start digging.
"Finn: Sure thing, boss."
Chow: We're on it.
Ratso: I love manual labor.
Hak foo: Hungry gopher digs hole.
Paco: The palenque pile driver!
"Mc cobra: Yo, mama, can't touch this."
(Cobra sucks in deep breath)
(Blows)
Black & viper: Aaah!
"Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i> à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>"
"<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i> ààya gaa mee chi-wah"
bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Jackie: I'll take the demon on the left.
Jade: Time for the seventh-inning butt whoop.
The amazing t-troop is in the house.
"Jackie: Jade, explain."
"Jade: don't worry, Jackie."
I have the dog talisman-- immortality.
And I brought enough for everybody:
"Invisible snake for viper,"
"superstrong ox for El toro,"
"combustible dragon for captain black,"
and speedy rabbit for uncle Jackie.
Supermoose: ¶ da-da-da-da-da-daaa! ¶
antler action!
"Paco: Hey, what about me?"
(Attack cries from all)
"(Big lift effort from Finn, chow, ratso, & hak foo)"
All: Whoa!
Uncle: Tohru!
Tohru: Oh... <i> Sensei.</i>
Uncle: Uncle is very pleased you are not pancake.
Where is Jade?
Tohru: She had the talismans. I told her to run.
"Finn: Hey, buddy."
Chow: Long time no see.
Ratso: Have you lost weight?
Uncle: Uncle did not tell you to visit.
Keep digging.
Finn: If big t's not our reinforcements...
Chow: Then who is?
Black: And <i> this</i> is for toasting my Van!
"(Viper stomps foot, grunts)"
Viper: 3 strikes... You're out.
Supermoose: ¶ pop goes the demon ¶
hyuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!
"Jade: ¶ hey, - batter, batter, batter ¶"
¶ sa-wing batter batter ¶
"paco: Jade, may I have a talisman, too?"
"Jade: Well, I was saving this one for myself,"
but...Knock yourself out.
Paco: Yes!
"Astro paco: Hang on, El toro! I am coming!"
Jade: Kids.
Astro paco: Finish him off with the Tijuana twister
or the cabo cannonball.
Astro paco: Jade!
"Drago: If that's the best you can do, chan."
Drago: The future belongs to me!
"Shendu: I think not, boy."
"First, you must pay for your treachery!"
Drago: Dad?
"Strikemaster ice: Yo, that thing's drago's pop?"
Tohru: Demon must defeat demon.
Jade: Tohru!
You're ok.
Hak foo: Charging rhino flatens giraffe!
Stubborn mule kick!
Komodo dragon paralyzes goat!
Finn: Maybe we'll sit this one out.
Chow: It looks like chan's got it covered.
Ratso: You think we could go get a Hot Dog?
"Drago: You're weak, old man!"
Conquest is a job for a fiery <i> young</i> dragon.
Shendu: You are an impudent child.
Jade: Shendu's - getting his butt whooped.
The talismans!
Jackie: Uhh!
"Uncle, you released shendu?"
How? Why?
Uncle: Uncle still have tricks up his sleeve.
Jade: Throw your talismans to shendu!
Repeat: Throw your talismans to shendu!
Supermoose: Mo-o-o-ose
muscle!
Shendu: I am complete!
"Tohru: <i> Sensei,</i>"
"if we cannot remove the demon chi from drago,"
perhaps we can remove drago from the earth.
Uncle: A reversal spell.
<i>Big</i> reversal spell.
Take this.
Uncle has been saving it.
Uncle & tohru : ¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
"strikemaster ice: This is whack, yo."
Drago: Father! Help me!
Shendu: You deserve such a fate for your disloyalty.
"Drago: I'm sorry, father!"
Please!
"Jade: Jackie, wait!"
Sometimes the greatest victory is the battle not fought.
Shendu: This is my domain.
Remember your place!
"Drago: Yes, father."
Psyche!
Shendu: No-o-o-o-o!
Uhh!
Uncle & tohru: ¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
¶ <i> yu-mo-gue-guai-</i> à <i> fie-Dee-tsao ¶</i>
Jade: Yes!
"Ratso: Aw, we missed the end."
Paco: Going somewhere?
Viper: Nice job.
We should team up more often.
Uncle: Keep it.
Graduation present.
You are full chi wizard.
"Jade: Go, tohru, you're a wizard. Oh, yeah!"
"Black: That was some good strategic thinking back there, young lady."
We could use someone like you at section 13.
Jade: You want me to be a real secret agent?
"Can I, Jackie? <i> Please?!</i>"
Jackie: Well... We'll talk later.
"Jade: Hey, that means no."
"Come on, Jackie. Our country needs me."
The <i> world</i> needs me.
Hak foo: Bear hug!
Drago: Ohh! The earth was within my grasp!
You never let me have what I want!
Shendu: I told you not to play with your father's world!
Drago: Why not? You aren't using it!
You're always too busy fighting wizards!
"Jade: Hey Jackie, have you ever worked with a crocodile?"
Jackie: Never.
That I've never done in my life.
"I touch rhino, lion..."
Elephant...
Yeah. Not crocodile.
